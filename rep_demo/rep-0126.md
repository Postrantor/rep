REP: 126 Title: New root element \"setup-file\" for rosinstall files Author: Tully Foote, Thibault Kruse Status: Draft Type: Standards Track Content-Type: text/x-rst Created: 10-Feb-2012 Post-History: 20-Feb-2012

> 回复：126 标题：rosinstall文件的新根元素“setup-file” 作者：Tully Foote，Thibault Kruse 状态：草案 类型：标准跟踪 内容类型：文本/x-rst 创建日期：2012年2月10日 发表历史：2012年2月20日

# Abstract


This REP suggests a new elements to extend the functionality of .rosinstall files, \"setup-file\". \"setup-file\" would indicate a path to a shell script to source in the setup.sh file.

> 这个REP建议添加一个新元素来扩展.rosinstall文件的功能，即“setup-file”。“setup-file”将指示一个指向setup.sh文件中要源的shell脚本的路径。

Note: the elements specified in this REP will only affect the tools used together with rosbuild packages: namely *rosinstall* and *rosws*. Newer tools like *wstool* intended to be used with catkin packages are not affected by these elements and will ignore them.

# Background


The rosinstall tool[^1] maintains a sorted set of folders, based on a .rosinstall file which states all local folders, and for each possibly a version control system (vcs) used for that folder and the uri of a remote repo.

> rosinstall 工具[^1]根据.rosinstall文件维护一组有序的文件夹，该文件声明了所有本地文件夹，以及可能用于该文件夹的版本控制系统（vcs）和远程存储库的uri。

An example of such a `.rosinstall` file in electric looks like this:

```
# .rosinstall in ros env
- other: {local-name: /opt/ros/electric/ros}
- other: {local-name: /opt/ros/electric/stacks}
- svn: {local-name: some/local/path, uri: some/uri, version: 123}
```


The syntax is in yaml, the file is a yaml list, with each element having a tag name in (other, svn, hg, git, bzr), a local name, a uri when tag name is an SCM, and optionally a version specifier.

> 语法是YAML，文件是一个YAML列表，每个元素都有一个标签名（其他，SVN，HG，GIT，BZR），本地名称，标签名为SCM时的URI以及可选的版本指定符。

The tool can initially checkout local folders, update to the latest changes, or to a specific version.


rosinstall also generates a set of files for shell initialization, defining a working environment. Those are `setup.sh`, `setup.bash`, `setup.zsh`. The essential one is `setup.sh`, which in electric may look like this:

> rosinstall也会生成一组用于shell初始化的文件，定义工作环境。这些文件是setup.sh、setup.bash和setup.zsh。关键的是setup.sh，在electric中可能看起来像这样：

```
# setup.sh in ros env
# distro-dependent lines
export ROS_ROOT=/opt/ros/electric/ros
export PATH=$ROS_ROOT/bin:$PATH
export PYTHONPATH=$ROS_ROOT/core/roslib/src:$PYTHONPATH
if [ ! "$ROS_MASTER_URI" ] ; then export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://localhost:11311 ; fi
# lines depending on all of .rosinstall
export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=some/local/path:/opt/ros/electric/stacks
```

rosinstall allows to have several separate working environments with different environment variables, and that by the setup.sh sets those variables.


The setup.sh prior to fuerte is entirely generated from the .rosinstall, using heuristic rules to determine a location of a ros distro among the elements of the .rosinstall, and setting environment variables accordingly.

> setup.sh在fuerte之前完全是通过.rosinstall生成的，使用启发式规则来确定.rosinstall中ROS发行版的位置，并相应地设置环境变量。


It is noteworthy for the following that while each setup.sh for ros environment set variables PATH, PYTHONPATH and ROS_MASTER_URI on its own, they were necessarily set the same way when going against the same ROS distro.

> 在使用相同的ROS发行版时，每个setup.sh为ROS环境设置的变量PATH、PYTHONPATH和ROS_MASTER_URI必须以相同的方式设置，这一点值得注意。

Also, for each entry in the .rosinstall, there is a resulting entry in the ROS_PACKAGE_PATH with the \'local-name\' value of the entry.


The setup.sh is never read by rosinstall, it is overwritten every time rosinstall successfully runs, it thus can so far not store information between runs of rosinstall.

> setup.sh永远不会被rosinstall读取，它每次rosinstall成功运行时都会被覆盖，因此到目前为止不能在rosinstall运行之间存储信息。


rosinstall works like this: it reads a given .rosinstall if there is any, merges it with any supplied command line arguments, then writes a new .rosinstall and new setup.sh files.

> rosinstall 像这样工作：它会读取给定的.rosinstall文件（如果有的话），将其与任何提供的命令行参数合并，然后生成新的.rosinstall文件和新的setup.sh文件。

The current rosinstall command line interface (CLI) syntax is as follows:

```
$ rosinstall [OPTIONS] INSTALL_PATH [ROSINSTALL FILES OR DIRECTORIES]*
```

This is the same for setting up a new environment, as well as updating or changing it.

The \[ROSINSTALL FILES OR DIRECTORIES\]\* arguments can each be

- a local file
- a local directory containing a .rosinstall file
- a remote file uri


With the first invocation of rosinstall in the `INSTALL_PATH`, one of the arguments must include the path to a ros installation, else rosinstall will fail with an error.

> 在`INSTALL_PATH`中第一次调用rosinstall时，其中一个参数必须包括ROS安装路径，否则rosinstall将会因错误而失败。

Note that the order of the arguments is the inverse order in which they will be appended to the `ROS_PACKAGE_PATH`, which for overlaying packages means that packages in locations of later arguments will overlay packages in locations of earlier arguments.


An important use-case for rosinstall is that a user may work on several ROS distros, and frequently switch between distros and environments. rosinstall generated setup files aim to enable a quick transistion between environments (and distros) by sourcing a given setup.sh.

> 采用rosinstall的一个重要场景是，用户可以在多个ROS发行版上工作，并经常在发行版和环境之间切换。rosinstall生成的设置文件旨在通过源指定的setup.sh快速地在环境（和发行版）之间进行转换。

# Specification

By default fuerte will create a `.rosinstall` file in `/opt/ros/fuerte` with contents similar to this:

```
- setup-file:
    local-name: /opt/ros/fuerte/setup.sh
- other:
    local-name: /opt/ros/fuerte/share/ros
  ...
```

A user can then create a local ros environment using the command:

```
$ rosinstall ~/fuerte foo /opt/ros/fuerte bar
```

And as a consequence, the generated local .rosinstall will look like this:

```
- other: {local-name: bar}
- other: {local-name: /opt/ros/fuerte/share/ros}
- setup-file: {local-name: /opt/ros/fuerte/setup.sh}
  ...
- other: {local-name: foo}
```

And the local `setup.sh` will look like this:

```
. /opt/ros/fuerte/setup.sh
export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=bar:...:/opt/ros/fuerte/share/ros:foo
```

# Motivation

Changes to the ROS build system in fuerte cause the current rosinstall approach to fail[^2].


The setup.sh as presented above is a self-contained script. This causes several problems in fuerte, where more environment variables have to be set up by several scripts maintained by default in `/opt/ros/fuerte/etc/catkin/profile.d`, but which could be placed in different locations, and rosinstall should be agnostic of that.

> setup.sh如上所示是一个独立的脚本。在fuerte中，由于默认在/opt/ros/fuerte/etc/catkin/profile.d中维护的多个脚本需要设置多个环境变量，而这些脚本可能放置在不同的位置，因此rosinstall应该是不受影响的。


The better way to go seems to let rosinstall only modify the `ROS_PACKAGE_PATH` variable, while letting the installation process of ros generate and maintain a setup.sh which sets the variables for this distro.

> 似乎最好的方法是让rosinstall只修改`ROS_PACKAGE_PATH`变量，而让ros的安装过程生成和维护一个设置脚本，用于设置这个发行版的变量。


The `.rosinstall` of a rosinstall environment then needs to point to the distro\'s setup.sh, such that the generated local setup.sh can first source that one, then amend the `ROS_PACKAGE_PATH`.

> `.rosinstall` 的环境需要指向发行版的setup.sh，以便生成的本地setup.sh可以首先源自此，然后修改`ROS_PACKAGE_PATH`。

The generated setup.sh within a rosinstall environment in fuerte should ideally look like this:

```
# setup.sh in ros env
. <path/to/distro/setup.sh>
# lines depending on all of .rosinstall
export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=some/local/path:/opt/ros/electric/stacks
```


As can be seen in comparison to the setup.sh in electric above, the part that depends on the distro could now replaced by sourcing the setup.sh of the distro.

> 照上面的Electric的setup.sh比較，可以看到取決於不同的發行版的部分現在可以用發行版的setup.sh來取代了。


The problem arising now is to identify in general where the distro `setup.sh` to include is located. rosinstall currently only stores information in its .rosinstall, which is currently limited to essentially storing the path to a set of local folders all of which currently are inserted into the `ROS_PACKAGE_PATH`.

> 现在出现的问题是一般来说如何找到distro `setup.sh`所在的位置。rosinstall目前只存储在其.rosinstall中的信息，这些信息目前仅限于存储一组本地文件夹的路径，所有这些文件夹都目前被插入到`ROS_PACKAGE_PATH`中。

The distro setup.sh is also not consistently located relative to any of the folders included in the `.rosinstall`.

So there currently is no way consistent with the current rosinstall capabilities to gather and store the location of the distro\'s setup.sh to use.


This REP declares therefore a necessary amendment to rosinstall to get and to store the location of a distro setup.sh file to be used for generation of environment setup.sh files.

> 因此，本 REP 宣布需要修改rosinstall以获取和存储用于生成环境设置setup.sh文件的distro setup.sh文件的位置。

# Rationale


The design needs to provide a solution for two requirements, finding out the intended distro folder the user wants to use for his environment, and storing that information for future invocations of rosinstall.

> 设计需要为两个要求提供解决方案，找出用户想要用于其环境的预期发行版文件夹，以及为将来调用rosinstall存储该信息。

## Alternatives for getting the location of distro setup.sh

In the future the setup.sh needs to be found independently of the location of the ros stack.

A)  Extend the syntax/semantics of the rosinstall command

> 1. first argument (on first invocation) needs to point to ros installation
> 2. ros installation given with \--option
> 3. first \"init\" invocation only allows one argument
> 4. special command, e.g. rosinstall-init, rosinstall init \...
> 5. first of the folders (of first invocation) containing any setup.sh assumed to be \"the one\"

B)  Extend the syntax of the .rosinstall files to provide the location of the rosinstall

> 1. new root element \"setup-file\" similar to elements \"other\"
> 2. \"other\" element flagged to indicate the folder of a file / a file to source
> 3. \"other\" element pointing to a file means \"source it\"

C)  Extend rosinstall\'s reasoning capabilities about ros distros

> 1. reliable detection of a \'distro folder\' by means of cue files (has .rosinstall, and setup.sh, an additional file or special strings in the ones there)

## Alternatives for storing the location of distro setup.sh

Rosinstall needs to remember the location of a setup.sh between invocations

D)  Find a way to store that piece of information in a .rosinstall file

> 1. new root element \"setup-file\" similar to elements \"other\"
> 2. \"other\" element flagged to indicate the folder of a file / a file to source
> 3. \"other\" element pointing to a file means \"source it\"

E)  Store that information in some other file

> 1. new file sourced by default, e.g. source_distro.sh
> 2. new file containing just the location of the setup.sh to source
> 3. the setup.sh (either in parseable format, or as a rosinstall-private env var)

## Other Alternatives

F)

> 1. rosinstall does not manage distro setup.sh, user has to first source distro, then local setup.sh

Reviewing the alternatives, it was decided that certain requirements should not be violated by the design.


R1: The rosinstall syntax and semantics should not change, in particular rosinstall should allow creating a local environment with the same command and options as before, and it should allow passing the distro folder as any of the arguments. This requirement is supposed to prevent users having to adapt to new syntax/semantics. (This discards all Alternatives A.)

> R1：rosinstall的语法和语义不应该改变，特别是rosinstall应该允许使用相同的命令和选项来创建本地环境，并且它应该允许将发行版文件夹作为任何参数传递。这个要求旨在防止用户不得不适应新的语法/语义。（这排除了所有的A选项。）


R2: rosinstall should not depend on a particular new layout of the ros distribution. Instead is shall fully depend on the ros distro providing information for rosinstall at is has done so up to now. The reason is that this causes the least effort to maintain several ROS distros. (this discards option C., as the existing layout of ros distributions do not permit to identify them as distro folders reliably).

> R2：rosinstall不应该依赖于特定的ROS发行版的新布局。它应该完全依赖ROS发行版提供的rosinstall信息，就像它迄今为止一直在做的那样。原因是这样做可以最小程度地维护几个ROS发行版。（这排除了选项C，因为现有的ROS发行版布局不能可靠地将它们识别为发行版文件夹）。


R3: All the environment information should be visible in a single .rosinstall file, and should be easily visible in that file. The reason is to keep rosinstall a \"simple\" tool, whose actions can be understood in terms of a single file. (This discards Options E.)

> R3：所有环境信息应该在单个.rosinstall文件中可见，并且在该文件中应该很容易可见。原因是为了让rosinstall保持“简单”的工具，其行为可以用单个文件来理解。（这抛弃了选项E。）

R4: User experience should not change (This discards Options F.)


Options C. and D. are equivalent, and it was decided to go for C.1. == D.1., meaning a new \"setup-files\" root element used both for getting the location of the setup file from a remote .rosinstall file as well as storing the information in a local .rosinstall file. C.2. and C.3. seemed to lack in transparency.

> 选项C.和D.是等价的，因此决定选择C.1.== D.1.，这意味着使用新的“setup-files”根元素既可从远程.rosinstall文件中获取设置文件的位置，也可以将信息存储在本地.rosinstall文件中。C.2.和C.3.似乎缺乏透明度。

# Concerns

## Backwards Compatibility


As rosinstall is released independently of the ROS distros. It is required that rosinstall continue working for other supported ROS distros while they remain supported. This is discussed in REP 3[^3]

> 随着rosinstall发布独立于ROS发行版，要求rosinstall在其他受支持的ROS发行版中继续工作，只要它们仍然受支持。这在REP 3[^3]中有所讨论。


To maintain backwards compatibility while older ROS distributions are still supported rosinstall will continue to append to / declare the following variables:

> 为了在支持旧版ROS发行版的同时保持向后兼容性，rosinstall将继续附加/声明以下变量：

```
export ROS_ROOT=/opt/ros/electric/ros
export PATH=$ROS_ROOT/bin:$PATH
export PYTHONPATH=$ROS_ROOT/core/roslib/src:$PYTHONPATH
if [ ! "$ROS_MASTER_URI" ] ; then export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://localhost:11311 ; fi
```

The backwards compatibility causes local setup.sh variables to contain empty paths. These lines:

```
export PATH=$ROS_ROOT/bin:$PATH
export PYTHONPATH=$ROS_ROOT/core/roslib/src:$PYTHONPATH
```

both add elements to PATH and PYTHONPATH which do not exist in fuerte, but would exist in earlier distros.


rosinstall can remove these lines as soon as electric is not supported anymore. An alternative is to detect the distro version (or the absence of a setup-file element), and not generate these lines when not needed. That decision is outside the scope of this REP.

> rosinstall可以一旦electric不再被支持，就可以移除这些行。另一种选择是检测发行版本（或缺少setup-file元素），当不需要时不生成这些行。这个决定不在本REP的范围之内。

## Future safety


The feature is created for no other use-case than to support the new layout used in fuerte, it should not be used for anything else. In future releases of ros, the layout is expected to change again, so the feature might be removed again.

> 这个功能仅为支持Fuerte中使用的新布局而创建，不应该用于其他任何用途。在ROS的未来版本中，布局预计会再次改变，因此此功能可能会被再次删除。


Also, a vision for rosinstall is to move away from being a ROS specific tool. As an abstraction it is a tool for operating on several local VCS repositories with a single command (multi-VCS), as well as a maintainer of a subset of local folders, roughly similar to an Eclipse workspace. The addition of a setup-file element does not fit into either category, and may hinder clean evolution of rosinstall.

> 此外，rosinstall的愿景是远离成为一个ROS特定的工具。作为一个抽象，它是一个用一个命令操作多个本地VCS存储库（多VCS）的工具，以及一个维护本地文件夹子集的工具，与Eclipse工作空间类似。添加设置文件元素不适合任何类别，可能会妨碍rosinstall的清洁演变。

## Safety


The system of sourcing files from locations given in remote rosinstall files can be abused, however we assume that the user must only use rosinstall to pull resources from trusted sources, else there are other obvious ways to introduce malicious code via rosinstall, so the concern is deemed irrelevant.

> 系统从远程rosinstall文件中给出的位置提取文件可能被滥用，但是我们假设用户只能使用rosinstall从可信源提取资源，否则通过rosinstall引入恶意代码的其他明显方式，因此担心被认为是无关紧要的。

## Source installs of ROS

Prior to fuerte, it was possible to build against ros modules which were not \"installed\" in any linux sense.

Beginning with fuerte, building modules migrates to allowing build only against installed ROS stacks and packages.

So from fuerte on, rosinstall only needs to support setting up environments against an installed ROS distro.

## Caveats


Should a user over time accumulate several setup-file entries in his rosinstall, the user will have to deal with the surprising effects this may cause by himself.

> 如果一个用户随着时间的推移积累了几个setup-file条目在他的rosinstall中，用户将不得不自己处理可能造成的令人惊讶的影响。

## Command line support


The \"setup-file\" element will not be supported by the ROS command line interface, as the only use-case it exists for is finding and storing the location of the distro folder. Users should be discouraged from using the new element for any other purpose.

> "setup-file" 元素不会被 ROS 命令行界面支持，因为它的唯一用途就是找到和存储发行版文件夹的位置。用户应该被阻止使用这个新元素来用于其他用途。

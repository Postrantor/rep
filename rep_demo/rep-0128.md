# Abstract

This REP provides naming conventions for how to refer to paths on a computer in documentation and debugging.

# Rationale


This REP has been written to make reading and writing documentation easier and more consistent and to remove ambiguities when communicating about the code layout of a specific installation.

> 这份文件旨在使阅读和书写文档更加容易和一致，并在沟通特定安装的代码布局时去除模糊不清的地方。

# Recommended Layout

The recommended layout for development is as follows:

```
workspace_folder/        --WORKSPACE
  src/                   --SOURCE SPACE
    CMakeLists.txt       --This is symlinked to catkin/cmake/toplevel.cmake
    package_1/
      CMakeLists.txt
      package.xml
    ...
    package_n/
      CATKIN_IGNORE      --Optionally place this marker file to exclude package_n from being processed. Its file type (e.g. regular file, directory) and contents don't matter. It may even be a dangling symlink.
      CMakeLists.txt
      package.xml
  build/                 --BUILD SPACE(this is where build system is invoked, not necessarily within workspace)
    CATKIN_IGNORE        --Marking the folder to be ignored when crawling for packages (necessary when source space is in the root of the workspace, the file is emtpy)
  devel/                 --DEVEL SPACE (targets go here, parameterizable, but defaults to peer of Build Space)
    bin/
    etc/
    include/
    lib/
    share/
    .catkin              --Marking the folder as a development space (the file contains a semicolon separated list of Source space paths)
    env.bash
    setup.bash
    setup.sh
    ...
  install/               --INSTALL SPACE (this is where installed targets for test installations go, not necessarily within workspace)
    bin/
    etc/
    include/
    lib/
    share/
    .catkin              --Marking the folder as an install space (the file is empty)
    env.bash
    setup.bash
    setup.sh
    ...
```

# Elements of the Workspace

When talking about a workspace used in development there are several names

## Workspace


The workspace is the folder inside which you are going to be actively developing. Keeping things in a folder with connected development helps keep separation of development models.

> 工作空间是您要积极开发的文件夹。将东西放在一个有关联开发的文件夹中有助于保持开发模型的分离。

## Source Space


The source space is the folder is where catkin will be expected to look for packages when building. This folder is easily identified as it is where the toplevel.cmake is linked from the catkin project.

> 源空间是文件夹，当构建时catkin将期望在其中查找软件包。这个文件夹很容易被识别，因为它是catkin项目中toplevel.cmake链接的地方。


Each catkin project desired to be compiled from source should be checked out into subdirectories inside this directory. Packages are found recursively so they do not have to be direct subfolders.

> 每个catkin项目期望从源代码编译，应该检出到该目录的子目录中。包可以递归查找，因此它们不必是直接的子文件夹。

## Build Space

The build space is the folder in which cmake is invoked and generates artifacts such as the CMakeCache

A typical invocation of cmake will look like this when following the recommended layout.

```
cmake ../src
```

## Development Space


The development space is where catkin generates the binaries and runtime libraries which are executable before installation. This folder will be an approximation of FHS layout however only containing artifacts from the associated source space.

> 研发空间是catkin生成可在安装前执行的二进制文件和运行时库的地方。这个文件夹将是FHS布局的近似，但只包含相关源空间的工件。

After the build step, inside this folder is expected everything needed to run nodes in packages which have been built.


The development space can not be a folder which contains ROS packages in subfolders. E.g. it can not equal to the workspace root as this would make the source space a subfolder which would lead to packages being found multiple times.

> 开发空间不能是一个包含ROS包的子文件夹的文件夹。例如，它不能等于工作区根，因为这会使源空间成为子文件夹，从而导致包被多次发现。

## Install Space


If `make install` is called this is the directory into which cmake will target all installations. Again creating an FHS style directory structure with a setup.(ba)sh in the root. This can be set to any directory using the `-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/any/directory` as an option to cmake. The cmake default is `/usr/local`.

> 如果调用`make install`，这是cmake将目标安装的目录。再次使用FHS风格的目录结构，在根目录创建一个setup。(ba)sh。可以使用`-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/any/directory`作为cmake的选项将其设置为任何目录。cmake的默认值是`/usr/local`。


The same restriction as for development spaces applies to the install space. This also implies that install spaces and development spaces must not be nested within each other.

> 同样的限制也适用于安装空间。这也意味着安装空间和开发空间不能嵌套在彼此之中。

### System Install Space


The system install space is a special category of the installation space which is expected to be a shared installation for all users on the system. Usually this is installed from your package manager. The default for this location is `/opt/ros/ROSDISTRO` where ROSDISTRO is the codename for the ROS distro being used.

> 系统安装空间是安装空间的特殊类别，预期是系统上所有用户的共享安装。通常使用包管理器安装。此位置的默认值是/opt/ros/ROSDISTRO，其中ROSDISTRO是正在使用的ROS发行版的代号。

## Result Space


The term result space can be used for either a development space or an install space. In cases where either of those two specific terms would do, the generic term should be used instead. To visually distinguish the result space from spaces that have a direct folder name correspondence (such as the folder `install` for the install space) it is recommended to refer to the result space as `RESULT-SPACE` in documentation, for example: :

> 结果空间这个术语可以用于开发空间或安装空间。在使用这两个特定术语的情况下，应使用通用术语。为了将结果空间与具有直接文件夹名称对应关系的空间（例如安装空间的文件夹`install`）进行可视化区分，建议在文档中将结果空间称为`RESULT-SPACE`，例如：

```
source RESULT-SPACE/setup.sh
```

# Overlays


In catkin style workspaces, overlaying of one workspace on top of another workspace is supported. Each overlay can be built on top of another overlay, and any packages in a higher overlay will mask out packages in lower overlays.

> 在catkin样式的工作区中，支持将一个工作区叠加在另一个工作区之上。每个叠加可以建立在另一个叠加之上，较高叠加中的任何软件包都将遮蔽较低叠加中的软件包。

Note: When overlaying any package all packages which depend on that package must be overlayed if they are intended to be used. This must be checked by the user creating the overlays. If a core package is overlayed and changes how it works, any package which depends on it and relies on the old behavior (whether runtime, or link time) will crash.


Catkin creates FHS \[CITE FHS\] style layouts in the devel and install spaces. \[cite above\] These spaces can be included into another workspace using the CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH pointing to either the devel space or install space. If it is an installed space make install must have been called, if a devel space, it must have been built with make.

> Catkin创建FHS[引用FHS]样式的布局在devel和install空间中。[引用上述]这些空间可以使用CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH指向devel空间或install空间来包含到另一个工作空间中。如果是安装空间，必须调用make install；如果是devel空间，必须使用make编译。

# Examples

Here are some examples showing basic usage.

Let us say we have several catkin workspaces in our home folder (\~/).

```
~/workspace1/
    src/
    build/
    devel/
~/workspace2/
    src/
    build/
    devel/
~/workspace3/
    src/
    build/
    devel/
```

Example 1: Installing workspace1 to system :

```
export CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt/ros/groovy
cd ~/workspace1/build
cmake ../src
make
make install
```

Alternatively you can set CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX when calling cmake in the third step: :

```
cd ~/workspace1/build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt/ros/groovy ../src
make
make install
```

Example 2: Overlaying workspace2 on top of workspace1\'s devel space :

```
source ~/workspace1/devel/setup.bash
cd ~/workspace2/build
cmake ../src
make
```

Example 3: Overlaying workspace 2 on top of workspace1\'s devel space on top of system installation :

```
source ~/workspace1/devel/setup.bash
cd ~/workspace2/build
cmake ../src
make
```

Example 4: Overlaying workspace 3 on top of local workspace2 install space on top of workspace1 devel space on top of system install :

```
cd ~/workspace2/build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=~/ws2_installed ../src
make
make install

source ~/ws2_installed/setup.bash

cd ~/workspace3/build
cmake ../src
make
```

# Mixing catkin And rosbuild Workspaces


catkin was designed to allow rosbuild packages to sit on top of catkin ones. This is accomplished by using overlays. A rosbuild overlay can overlay either a catkin workspace devel space or installspace. The setup.*sh file for the rosbuild workspace will, when sourced, also source the respective setup.*sh of the catkin workspace.

> catkin被设计用来允许rosbuild包位于catkin包之上。这是通过使用覆盖实现的。rosbuild覆盖可以覆盖catkin工作区的devel空间或installspace。rosbuild工作区的setup.*sh文件在源时也会源自catkin工作区的相应setup.*sh文件。


Though one could technically utilize the same folder for a rosbuild workspace and a catkin workspace, our recommended layout is to isolate rosbuild and catkin workspaces in their own folders.

> 尽管技术上可以将同一文件夹用作rosbuild工作区和catkin工作区，但我们建议将rosbuild和catkin工作区隔离到自己的文件夹中。

```
~/rosbuild_ws/
   dry_pkg1/
   ...
   dry_pkgN/
   setup.bash
   setup.sh
~/catkin_ws/
   src/
     wet_pkg1/
     ...
     wet_pkgN/
   build/
   devel/
     setup.bash
     setup.sh
   install/
     setup.bash
     setup.sh
```

The steps to achieve this layout are:

1. Create catkin_ws and catkin_ws/src folder
2. Run catkin_make in catkin_ws
3. Run rosws init \~/rosbuild_ws/ \~/catkin_ws/devel (or install)

With this layout, sourcing \~/rosbuild_ws/setup.*sh also sources \~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.*sh

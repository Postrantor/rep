> 回应：2006 标题：ROS 2 漏洞披露政策 作者：ROS 2 安全工作组，Chris Lalancette <clalancette@openrobotics.org> 状态：活跃 类型：信息内容类型：text/x-rst 创建日期：2020 年 5 月 12 日 发布历史：

# Abstract


This REP describes the Vulnerability Disclosure Policy related to the ROS 2 Common Packages as defined in [REP-2005](https://www.ros.org/reps/rep-2005.html).

> 这份 REP 描述了与在[REP-2005](https://www.ros.org/reps/rep-2005.html)中定义的ROS 2 公共软件包相关的漏洞披露政策。

# Motivation


The developers of the Robot Operating System (ROS) take security very seriously. As such, we would like to be informed when a security bug is found so that it can be fixed and disclosed as quickly as possible. The rest of the document outlines what is covered by this policy and how to report security vulnerabilities.

> 开发人员非常重视机器人操作系统（ROS）的安全性。因此，我们希望在发现安全漏洞时得到通知，以便尽快修复和披露。本文档的其余部分概述了本政策所涵盖的内容以及如何报告安全漏洞。

# Scope

The Vulnerability Disclosure Program outlined here covers all code within the ROS 2 Common Packages as defined in REP 2005.


The ROS Security Working Group may also be able to assist you with reporting vulnerabilities which are not in scope of this policy but which are related to ROS or more generally to robotics. An increasing number of companies are bringing ROS-based products to market, and during this growth period we anticipate vulnerabilities to be identified in products before vendors have an established vulnerability reporting program. We will work with you on a best-effort basis to help connect you with responsible parties best suited to address your concerns.

> ROS安全工作组也可能协助您报告与ROS或更广泛的机器人技术相关的、但不在本政策范围内的漏洞。越来越多的公司正在推出基于ROS的产品，在这个增长期间，我们预计在供应商建立漏洞报告程序之前，将会发现产品中的漏洞。我们将尽力协助您与最适合处理您的问题的负责任者连接。

# How to submit a vulnerability


Please submit vulnerability reports by emailing <security@openrobotics.org>, preferably in English. This is a private list of security officers who can help verify the bug report and develop and release a fix. The more information provided about the bug, the easier it will be to fix. If you already have a fix, please include it with your report. We may ask to exchange PGP keys to discuss sensitive details about the vulnerability which may include proof-of-concept code, an impact assessment, recommended remediation steps or other information that will help us find and fix the problem.

> 请通过发送电子邮件至<security@openrobotics.org>提交漏洞报告，最好使用英文。这是一个私人安全官员列表，可以帮助验证漏洞报告，开发和发布修复程序。提供的漏洞信息越多，修复起来就越容易。如果您已经有了修复方案，请将其随报告一起提交。我们可能会要求交换PGP密钥，以讨论有关漏洞的敏感信息，其中可能包括概念验证代码、影响评估、推荐的缓解步骤或其他有助于我们找到和修复问题的信息。


Include any plans you may have to disclose details about the vulnerability. In order to protect our users, unless otherwise agreed by both parties, we ask that you not publicly discuss the vulnerability until a fix is published or at least 90 days have passed since the initial report submission. The group handling the report will also follow this timeline. If you do not wish to be acknowledged in the release communications please indicate so when you submit the vulnerability.

> 请提供您可能有的披露漏洞细节的计划。为了保护我们的用户，除非双方另有约定，我们要求您在发布修复程序或至少自报告提交以来90天过去之前不要公开讨论漏洞。处理报告的小组也将遵循这个时间表。如果您不希望在发布消息中被提及，请在提交漏洞时指出。

# What to expect in response to a vulnerability disclosure

Expect a timely response to your notification, normally within two business days, during which time we will triage your vulnerability report.


After we have evaluated the vulnerability we will send you our risk assessment and, where applicable, the anticipated time to publish an update. Where appropriate, we will coordinate and assign a vulnerability ID with an industry-standard. We will aim at being as transparent as possible about timelines and any issues or challenges which may impact the scheduled fix.

> 在我们评估漏洞后，我们将向您发送我们的风险评估，以及适用的预期发布更新的时间。在适当的情况下，我们将协调并分配一个具有行业标准的漏洞ID。我们将尽力在时间表和可能影响计划修复的任何问题或挑战方面尽可能透明。


Should the vulnerability have a widespread impact that requires coordinated disclosure, we may, at our discretion, choose to engage a neutral third party such as CERT/CC or ICS-CERT to support coordination efforts.

> 如果漏洞具有广泛的影响，需要协调披露，我们可以根据自己的判断，选择聘请一个中立的第三方，如CERT/CC或ICS-CERT，来支持协调工作。


We will notify you when a pull request has been submitted and approved which remediates the vulnerability. Because security vulnerabilities can have severe consequences, they differ from other bugs and at our discretion\-- in order to protect our users\-- we may modify our normal code release processes for publishing open source code updates.

> 我们会在提交并批准修复漏洞的拉取请求时通知您。由于安全漏洞可能会造成严重的后果，它们与其他错误不同，为了保护我们的用户，我们可能会根据自己的判断修改正常的代码发布流程，以发布开源代码更新。

# Safe Harbor


Open Robotics strongly supports security research into ROS software and seeks to encourage that research. Open Robotics will not engage in legal action against individuals who act in good faith to identify, report and fix vulnerabilities in ROS, so long as they operate in accordance with any applicable laws or this policy. Research or testing against operating robotic systems without the consent of the owner/operator is in violation of this policy and strongly discouraged due to potential health and human safety concerns.

> 开放机器人强烈支持对ROS软件的安全研究，并寻求鼓励这些研究。开放机器人将不会对那些出于善意识别、报告和修复ROS漏洞的个人采取法律行动，只要他们遵守任何适用的法律或本政策。未经所有者/操作者同意而对操作机器人系统进行研究或测试违反了本政策，由于可能存在健康和人类安全方面的问题，强烈不推荐这样做。

If at any time you have concerns about whether your activities are consistent with this policy, please contact us at <security@openrobotics.org>.

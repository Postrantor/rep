REP: 115 Title: rosco and roslocate tools for rosinstall Author: Ken Conley \<<kwc@willowgarage.com>\> Status: Final Type: Standards Track Content-Type: text/x-rst Created: 01-Sep-2011 Post-History: 01-Sep-2011, 02-Sep-2011

# Abstract

This REP proposes two updates to rosinstall: `roslocate` and `rosco`. `roslocate` enables users to locate rosinstall entries and other information about ROS stacks and packages. `rosco` supports source-control checkout of any rosinstall entry.

# rosinstall entry

This specification frequently refers to [rosinstall entries]{.title-ref}. To clarify the meaning of this, in this REP we use rosinstall entry to mean a single YAML list element that describes source control information for rosinstall.

Example:

```
- hg:
    local-name: common
    meta:
      repo-name: wg-kforge
    uri: https://kforge.ros.org/common/common
    version: default
```

# Motivation

## rosco

`rosinstall`[^1] is a useful tool for managing a consistent development tree of multiple ROS stacks. It takes care of important environment configuration, tree updates, and more. It is less useful in situations where you just want to quickly get the source for a particular stack or package as it does more than just retrieve code.

For example, you want to add a stack to an existing checkout, you may have to:

1. Lookup the rosinstall entry for the package/stack using `roslocate`.
2. Update your rosinstall configuration with this information.
3. Run rosinstall, which will iterate through all entries in the rosinstall configuration.

If you have multiple entries in the rosinstall configuration, you will have to wait as rosinstall examines each entry for updates.

`rosco` is instead motivated by \"give me the source, now.\" In exchange for this haste, it does not do any bookkeeping or environment configuration for you: it is tries to be equivalent to running `svn co`, `git clone`, or the like.

## roslocate

`roslocate` is a tool for finding version-control and other information about a ROS package or stack. The main use case is \"locate the source code repository of this resource,\" though it can also provide additional metadata about that resource. It is designed to be a command-line interface for accessing information produced by the ROS.org indexing system, which crawls the known public repositories of ROS-compatible software.

`roslocate` has existed for quite some time in ROS, though its current incarnation is fairly recent. A new prototype was written in December 2010[^2] to emit rosinstall entries as the original version was SVN-centric and had scaling issues. The prototype was later included with `rosinstall` to test its usefulness. After upgrades to the ROS.org indexing system were made, an updated version of this prototype was introduced on `ros-developers` in July 2011[^3] to add distribution-specific searches for its commands (`--dev`, `--distro`).

Although `roslocate` has existed for awhile in various forms, it has not been formally specified. As there are now tools like `rosco` and `rosws`[^4] that depend on this API, it is more important to provide this specification.

# Specification

## roslocate API

`roslocate` has a command-based API. Each of the commands is described below.

### describe

`roslocate describe` summarizes information about a ROS package or stack.

Example:

```
$ roslocate describe rosinstall

Type: package
Stack: ros_release
Description: rosinstall is a tool to check out ROS source code (or any source code, really) from multiple version control repositories and updating these checkouts. Given a *.rosinstall file that specifies where to get code, rosinstall will check out a working copy for you. We recommend the use of rosinstall when checking out development versions of ROS source code. This package is where the code lives, however it is not expected for users to checkout and use this package directly.  It is expected that users use the version available through pypi.python.org.
URL: http://ros.org/wiki/rosinstall
```

### info

Prints the rosinstall entry for the resource.

Example:

```
$ roslocate info common
- hg:
    local-name: common
    meta:
      repo-name: wg-kforge
    uri: https://kforge.ros.org/common/common
    version: default
```

### repo

Prints the name of the repository the resource is stored in. This repository name is for display purposes only \-- it cannot be used as input to source control tools.

Example:

```
$ roslocate repo cram_pl
tum-ros-pkg
```

### uri

Prints the source control URI of a resource. This is mainly intended as input to other programs via shell backtick or pipe.

Example:

```
$ roslocate uri rospy
https://code.ros.org/svn/ros/stacks/ros_comm/trunk/clients/rospy
```

### vcs

Prints the type of version control system used for the resource. Possible values include `svn`, `hg`, `git`, and `bzr`.

Example:

```
$ roslocate vcs common
hg
```

### www

Prints the website of a resource.

Example:

```
$ roslocate www rospy
http://ros.org/wiki/rospy
```

### \--distro=DISTRO_NAME

If the `--distro=DISTRO_NAME` option is combined with a roslocate command, the information returned will be based on a particular distribution release of a resource.

Example:

```
$ roslocate info rospy
- svn:
    local-name: rospy
    uri: https://code.ros.org/svn/ros/stacks/ros_comm/trunk/clients/rospy

$ roslocate info rospy --distro=diamondback
- svn:
    local-name: ros_comm
    uri: https://code.ros.org/svn/ros/stacks/ros_comm/tags/ros_comm-1.4.7
```

### \--dev

If the `--dev` option is combined with a roslocate command, the information returned will be based on the development branch of the resource (e.g. `trunk`), if possible. It should be used in combination with the `--distro=DISTRO_NAME` option as development trees are indexed based on a particular ROS distribution.

The `-dev` option generally only affects source control information, like URIs and rosinstall entries. Other information, like resource descriptions, are not guaranteed to be development-branch specific.

Example:

```
$ roslocate info rospy --distro=electric
- svn:
    local-name: ros_comm
    uri: https://code.ros.org/svn/ros/stacks/ros_comm/tags/ros_comm-1.6.0

$ roslocate info rospy --distro=electric --dev
- svn:
    local-name: ros_comm
    uri: https://code.ros.org/svn/ros/stacks/ros_comm/trunk
```

## rosco command-line API

The `rosco` command is roughly equivalent to running the equivalent `svn`, `git`, or other source control tool to \"checkout\" or \"clone\" a repository. It does not record any additional state.

### rosco \<package-or-stack\>

Searches for the specified ROS package or stack and retrieves the source code use the appropriate version control tool. For example, if the source code is stored in a Subversion repository, `rosco` will run a `svn checkout` of the resource in the local directory.

### rosco \--rosinstall \<rosinstall-file\>, rosco -r \<rosinstall-file\>

For each entry in the rosinstall file, retrieve the source code use the appropriate version control tool. Unlike `rosinstall`, it only retrieves the source code and nothing more.

### piped input

`rosco` also accepts piped input formatted as rosinstall entries. This is primarily meant to be used in combination with `roslocate`.

Example:

```
$ roslocate info rospy | rosco
```

### \--distro=DISTRO_NAME

Checkout the source code for a particular ROS distribution release, e.g. `rosco rospy --distro=electric` will checkout the Electric release of rospy. This option is not valid when used with `--rosinstall`.

### \--dev

The `--dev` option causes `rosco` to checkout the development branch instead. It should be specified in combination with a `--distro=DISTRO_NAME` option as development branches are distribution specific.

## Packaging

`rosco` and `roslocate` are distributed as scripts with the rosinstall PyPI package.

# Rationale

## rosco API

The original `rosco` prototype had a different command-line specification:

```
rosco <rosinstall-file>
```

This style favored rosinstall entries for the API. The revised API is based on discussions with Ibrahim Awwal on ros-users[^5]. Ibrahim wrote a different `rosco` prototype that favored package and stack names as the primary argument. This syntax is more direct as it omits the intermediate step of having to run the `roslocate` tool to generate the rosinstall data.

## \--dev

Both `roslocate` and `rosco` return the released version of a stack by default. Thus, by default, users will get a working code tree. There is also no option to select between the version-based tag and a distribution-based tag of a resource: the version-based tag is always used. This simplifies the command-line API as users don\'t have to distinguish between these two different types of tags. Although tracking tags, e.g. distribution-based tags, are useful, they encounter issues on VCS tools like `git` and we may phase them out in the future.

# Compatibility

## Removal of `roslocate rosinstall`

This REP removes the `roslocate rosinstall` command that was part of the prototype tool. Originally, `roslocate` had separate `rosinstall` and `info` subcommands. The `rosinstall` command was meant to return the exact rosinstall entry used to generate the index information, whereas `info` was meant to provide more advanced URL computations, like returning the URL of a specific package inside a stack. The distinction between these two was confusing and dependent on the implementation of the indexer.

## rosco

The new `rosco` API is not compatible with the original prototype. As the original prototype had limited visiblity, this is assumed to not be a major issue.

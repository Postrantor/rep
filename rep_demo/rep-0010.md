REP: 10 Title: Voting Guidelines Author: Ken Conley \<<kwc@willowgarage.com>\> Status: Active Type: Process Content-Type: text/x-rst Created: 19-Sep-2010 Post-History: 19-Sep-2010

# Abstract

This REP outlines the ros-developers voting guidelines. These guidelines serve to provide feedback or gauge the \"wind direction\" on a particular proposal, idea, or feature. They don\'t have a binding force.

REP 10 is a direct copy of PEP 10[^1] by Barry Warsaw. The Author field of this document has been updated to reflect responsiblity for maintenance.

# Rationale

When a new idea, feature, patch, etc. is floated in the ROS community, either through a REP or on the mailing lists (most likely on ros-developers), it is sometimes helpful to gauge the community\'s general sentiment. Sometimes people just want to register their opinion of an idea. Sometimes the ROS Developers like to perform simple arithmetic operations. Whatever the reason, these guidelines have been adopted so as to provide a common language for developers.

While opinions are (sometimes) useful, but they are never binding. Opinions that are accompanied by rationales are always valued higher than bare scores (this is especially true with -1 votes).

# Voting Scores

There are 4 possible vote scores:

```
+1 I like it

+0 I don't care, but go ahead

-0 I don't care, so why bother?

-1 I hate it
```

You may occasionally see wild flashes of enthusiasm (either for or against) with vote scores like +2, +1000, or -1000. These aren\'t really valued much beyond the above scores, but it\'s nice to see people get excited about such geeky stuff.

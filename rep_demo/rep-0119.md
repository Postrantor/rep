# Abstract


This REP outlines compatibility defintions for TurtleBot compatible platforms. The TurtleBot is a specific product, but it is an Open Hardware Design released under the FreeBSD Documentation License.[^2] The purpose of this document is to differentiate the critical design features which are necessary for compatability from the other design features which can be modified without functionally effecting the core design. This document is meant to be a guideline for the development of new cheaper or more functional robots that can still leverage the development efforts of the TurtleBot community.

> 这份报告概述了TurtleBot兼容平台的兼容性定义。TurtleBot是一款特定的产品，但它是根据FreeBSD文档许可证发布的开放硬件设计。[^2]本文档的目的是将兼容性所必需的关键设计特征与可以在不影响核心设计功能的情况下进行修改的其他设计特征区分开来。本文档旨在为开发新的更便宜或更功能强大的机器人提供指导，以便仍然可以利用TurtleBot社区的开发努力。

# Motivation


Developers of TurtleBot applications, hardware accessories, models, and libraries need a share convention for compatibility in order to better integrate and re-use software and hardware components. Shared conventions for compatibility provides a specification for developers creating new hardware configurations, and accessories for TurtleBot compatible platforms. Similarly, developers creating libraries and applications can more easily use their software with robots that are compatible with this specification.

> 开发TurtleBot应用程序、硬件配件、模型和库的人们需要一个兼容性的共享约定，以便更好地整合软件和硬件组件，并重新使用它们。兼容性的共享约定为开发者创建新的硬件配置和TurtleBot兼容平台的配件提供了一个规范。同样，开发库和应用程序的开发人员可以更轻松地使用他们的软件与符合此规范的机器人。

It is expected that most tools and applications written for a TurtleBot should run on a Level 1 compatible robot.

There are many tools and applications written for the TurtleBot which can be useful for other similar robots. Level 2 compatible robots are a subset of these robots for which a majority of the applications will work. There are already a number of robots which are TurtleBot compatible such as Mini Max[^3] and Pi Robot[^4] .

> 有许多专为TurtleBot编写的工具和应用程序，可用于其他类似机器人。符合Level 2兼容性的机器人是这些机器人的一个子集，大多数应用程序都可以工作。已经有许多机器人与TurtleBot兼容，如Mini Max[^3]和Pi Robot[^4]。

# TurtleBot Core Features


TurtleBot is a low-cost, open-source software and hardware personal robotics kit. The TurtleBot main hardware features include a mobile base, rgbd sensor, on board computation, wireless communication, and expansion space for adding new hardware.

> TurtleBot是一款低成本、开源软硬件的个人机器人套件。TurtleBot的主要硬件特性包括移动底座、rgbd传感器、板载计算、无线通信以及扩展空间，以便添加新的硬件。

# Compatibility Specification


There are two levels of compatability defined in this REP. Level 1 compatable robots are expected to be able to be swapped out without significant code changes. Level 2 compatable robots are expected to be able to share significant software components, but may require non-trivial changes to software between robots.

> 在本REP中定义了两个兼容性级别。第一级兼容性机器人预计可以在不需要显著代码更改的情况下进行替换。第二级兼容性机器人预计可以共享重要的软件组件，但可能需要在机器人之间进行非平凡的软件更改。

Below are the specifications for each of the levels of compliance:

## Level 1

Robots that are level 1 compatible meet the following requirements as well as all Level 2 requirements.

### Hardware Requirements


The following hardware requirements are to ensure that the default TurtleBot software runs without modification on the robot and to ensure accessory compatibility between TurtleBot compatible robots.

> 以下硬件要求旨在确保TurtleBot软件可以在机器人上无需修改即可运行，并确保TurtleBot兼容机器人间的附件兼容性。


- The robot must have a rgbd camera with a base_link to camera_rgb_frame translation of \[x:-0.087m, y:-0.0125m, z:0.287m\], as specified in the turtlebot.xacro file in the turtlebot_description package.

> 机器人必须具有带有基础链接到相机RGB帧转换的RGBD摄像头，其转换为\[x:-0.087m, y:-0.0125m, z:0.287m\]，如turtlebot_description包中turtlebot.xacro文件中所指定。

- The top mounting surface of the robot must provide a hole grid pattern centered around the z-axis of the robot base_link that is identical to the 68-04541_TurtleBot_Plate_2 part found in the TurtleBot hardware documentation and shown in the figure below.

> 顶部安装表面的机器人必须提供一个网格孔模式，该模式围绕机器人基座链接的z轴居中，与TurtleBot硬件文档中找到的68-04541_TurtleBot_Plate_2部件相同，如下图所示。
- The top mounting surface of the robot must be 0.2032m (8 inches) from rgbd camera mounting surface.
- The robot fits within a a circle 0.35m in diameter
- The robot must provide at least the following power buses:
  - 12V at 1.5A with a male Micro Fit 1x2 connector (Molex 43045-0209)
  - 5V at 500mA solderable connection (If connectorized use Micro Fit 2x1 connector (Molex 43650-0218) )
- Accurate Deadreckoning:
  - Drive pattern TODO with less than X inches offset and Y radians offset.

### Software Requirements

The TurtleBot stacks (turtlebot, turtlebot_viz, turtlebot_apps, turtlebot_arm) must run on the robot without user modification.


Distributors of TurtleBot Level 1 compatible robots should provide the following software and configuration files if they are different than the TurtleBot:

> 经销商出售TurtleBot Level 1兼容机器人时，如果它们与TurtleBot不同，应提供以下软件和配置文件：

- A node which implements the TurtleBot Node Core ROS API listed below.
- Provide equivilant diagnostics with turtlebot_node[^5]
- Provide turtlebot.launch file to replace turtlebot_bringup/upstart/turtlebot.launch
- If the RGBD sensor requires a breaker to turn on it will use \"Breaker 0\"
- If an attached arm requires a breaker to turn on it will use \"Breaker 1\"

### TurtleBot Node Core API

Subscribed Topics

> -
>
> ```
> cmd_vel (geometry_msgs/Twist)

## Level 2

Robots that are level 2 compatible meet the following requirements as well as all the hardware extensions and modification requirements.

### Hardware Requirements

- An RGBD sensor
- A mobile robot base
- A computer capable of running ROS and processing the RGBD sensor at full frame rate.

  - Note: most RGBD sensors require a full USB 2.0 bus to operate correctly, thus most computers will require 2 USB busses if USB periferals are expected to be used.

> 注意：大多数RGBD传感器需要一个完整的USB 2.0总线才能正常工作，因此，如果需要使用USB外围设备，大多数计算机将需要2个USB总线。
- Odometry is expected to be accurate within 1% after calibration in both linear and angular movement.

### Software Requirements

- URDF description of the robot
- The origin of the base_link is at the rotation point of an in-place turn.
- The depth sensor should publish in the \"camera\" namespace
- The base moves based on [geometry_msgs/Twist](http://www.ros.org/doc/api/geometry_msgs/html/msg/Twist.html) on the \"cmd_vel\" topic
  - If the base is not holonomic, only the components of the command which are achievable should be executed.
- The base publishes [nav_msgs/Odometry](http://www.ros.org/doc/api/nav_msgs/html/msg/Odometry.html) on the \"odom\" topic
- REP 105[^6] compliant

## Hardware Extensions and Modifications

When adding or creating new hardware for TurtleBot compliant robots distributors should use the following guidelines and conventions:

### Location Naming Conventions

Location names should be generic and have semantic meaning with respect to the robot hardware, below are examples of common location names:

- base
- torso
- head
- arm
  - shoulder
  - upper_arm
  - elbow
  - forearm
  - wrist
  - gripper

### Sensor Naming Convetions

Whenever possible it is prefered to use the following convention naming for sensor topics/namespaces LOCATION_TYPE. For example:

- base_scan
- head_camera
- forearm_camera

### Link, Joint, and Frame Naming Conventions

Whenever possible it is prefered to use the following convention naming for links and connecting joints LOCATION_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE. For example:

Common Joint Descriptors are:

- flex
- lift
- pan
- roll
- tilt

Examples are:

- arm_shoulder_pan_link, arm_shoulder_pan_joint
- head_tilt_link, head_tilt_joint
- forearm_link, elbow_flex_joint

Whenever possible it is prefered to use the following convention naming for links and sensors LOCATION_SENSOR_TYPE. For example:

- head_camera_rgb_link, head_camera_rgb_optical_frame

### URDF


When providing an accessory or extension for a Level 1 or 2 TurtleBot compatable robot a URDF description of the extension should be provided which provides at least collision geometries and visualization meshes.

> 当为Level 1或2 TurtleBot兼容机器人提供附件或扩展时，应提供URDF描述，它至少提供碰撞几何和可视化网格。

# Simulation


There is a package which provides the necessary Gazebo model for Level 1 compliant robots. See the turtlebot_simulator stack [^7] for more information.

> 有一个包提供符合第一级要求的机器人所需的Gazebo模型。有关更多信息，请参阅turtlebot_simulator堆栈[^7]。


It is recommended for Level 2 compliant robots to release a stack with the gazebo model(s) which allows them to be simulated as well, to ease development for developers who do not always have access to hardware.

> 建议 Level 2 符合要求的机器人发布一个带有 Gazebo 模型的堆栈，这样可以让它们也可以模拟，以便于那些没有硬件访问权限的开发者更轻松地开发。

![The TurtleBot simulated in Gazebo](rep-0119/turtlebot_sim.png)

# Exceptions


The scope of potential robotics software is too broad to require all ROS software to follow the guidelines of this REP. However, choosing different conventions should be well justified and well documented.

> 范围太广泛，不需要所有ROS软件都遵循本REP的指南。但是，选择不同的约定应该有充分的理由并且有良好的文档记录。

# Existing REP Compliance

This REP is built upon previous REPs and ROS best practices. All implementations should do the same. Specifically relevant ones are listed below.

REP 103[^8] Standard Units of Measure and Coordinate Conventions

:   All units will follow REP 103 and all cooridnate frames will follow the conventions in REP 103.

REP 105[^9] Coordinate Frames for Mobile Platforms

:   The coordinate frames for the mobile base will follow REP 105.

REP 107[^10] Diagnostic System for Robots Running ROS

:   All hardware drivers should provide diagnostic information via the diagnostic_msgs interface of REP 107.

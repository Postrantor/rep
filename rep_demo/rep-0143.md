# Abstract

This REP updates the specification of the ROS distribution files facilitated in the building, packaging, testing and documenting process.

The intention is to separate the buildfarm related configuration options from the information describing the ROS packages and repositories[^2].

This REP is a revised version of REP 141[^3]. It currently does not repeat the content of REP 141 but only states the differences.

# Specification

## Index file

- distributions

  - distribution: list of reference to the distribution files A single distribution file guarantees that there are no duplicate repositories and is therefore preferred. But when running a custom buildfarm which only adds custom repositories it is much smoother to maintain them in a separate file to avoid any kind of conflicts.

> - 分发：对分发文件的引用列表。单个分发文件可以保证没有重复的存储库，因此更受青睐。但是，当运行只添加自定义存储库的自定义构建农场时，将它们放在单独的文件中以避免任何冲突会更加顺畅。

    The files are read in the order they are listed and entries in later distribution files are overwriting entries from previous distribution files. This can be used to override specific repositories with either a forked variant or a specific version number. `bloom` will create pull requests against the last distribution file since even when the repository is present in any of the other distribution files the \"overlaying\" version should be stored in the last one.
  - release_builds / source_builds / doc_builds: are being removed since they only contain information relevant to the buildfarm
- version: version number, this REP describes version 3 (instead of version 2 described in REP 141[^4] and version 1 described in REP 137[^5])

## Distribution file

- repositories
  - source
    - test_commits: a boolean flag used to enable CI jobs for each commit to the branch specified under `versions`. (default: false)
    - test_pull_requests: a boolean flag used to enable CI jobs for each pull request against the branch specified under `version`. (default: false)
    - version: if `test_pull_requests` is enabled the version must specify a branch.

- tags: list of tag names to identify the group of repositories specified by the distribution file. It allows build files to refer to sets of repositories / packages based on in which distribution file they are defined.

> - 标签：用于标识由分发文件指定的存储库组的标签名称列表。它允许构建文件根据定义在哪个分发文件中来引用存储库/软件包的集合。
- version: version number, this REP describes version 2 (instead of version 1 described in REP 141[^6] and REP 137[^7])

## Reference implementation


This REP is to be implemented in version 0.4 of the Python package *rosdistro*. It will serve as a reference implementation for this REP. A draft implementation can be found in[^8].

> 此 REP 将在 Python 包 *rosdistro* 的 0.4 版本中实施。它将作为此 REP 的参考实施。可以在[^8]中找到草案实施。

# Compatibility issues

The draft implementation of rosdistro is able to parse both index format version 2 as well as 3.

To leverage the new ability to list multiple distribution files the following additional API will be introduced:

- rosdistro.get_distribution_files()


The existing API (\'rosdistro.get_distribution_file()\') will continue to provide the correct data by merging the information from all distribution files.

> 现有的API（'rosdistro.get_distribution_file()'）将通过合并所有分发文件的信息继续提供正确的数据。

All function related to the removed build files will simply return empty lists.


As soon as the new version of \'rosdistro\' is released the \'ros/rosdistro\' repository[^9] is being updated to the new format (for Hydro and higher). Any client accessing trying to access the data with an old \'rosdistro\' version will get an error message like this:

> 当新版本的'rosdistro'发布时，'ros/rosdistro'存储库[^9]将更新为新格式（适用于Hydro及更高版本）。任何使用旧版本'rosdistro'访问数据的客户端都会收到如下错误消息：

```
Unable to handle 'index' format version '3', please update rosdistro...
```

## Affected tools

The only tool beside the \"old\" buildfarm accessing the raw rosdistro data which needs to be updated is \'rosdep\'[^10].

All other tools using the API of rosdistro (even if deprecated) will continue to work.

In order to allow releasing packages into rosdistro repositories with multiple distribution files \'bloom\' will need to be updated[^11].

# Note (2013-06-26)

This REP describes information related to the legacy build system rosbuild.

# Abstract


The definition of ROS stacks and packages is changed to enable a directory to be both a stack and a package. We call this combined entity a *unary stack* to indicate that it is a stack with a single package entity.

> 定义ROS堆栈和软件包已经改变，以使一个目录既可以是一个堆栈，也可以是一个软件包。我们称这个组合实体为*单一堆栈*，以表示它是一个具有单个软件包实体的堆栈。

# Motivation


ROS enables developers to organize directories into both *packages* and *stacks*. Packages are the basic unit of the ROS build system and they typically contain libraries, nodes, and configuration files. Stacks are the basic unit of the ROS release system

> ROS可以让开发者将目录组织成*包*和*堆栈*。 包是ROS构建系统的基本单元，通常包含库、节点和配置文件。 堆栈是ROS发行系统的基本单元。


Packages and stacks are usually organized at different levels of granularity. Packages are focused on build products and thus follow a \'Goldilocks\' principle: enough functionality to be useful, not too much to be heavyweight. A package might provide an implementation of a specific algorithm or data structure.

> 包和堆栈通常在不同的粒度水平上组织。 包专注于构建产品，因此遵循“金发奇缘”原则：足够的功能有用，不要太多，以免变得笨重。 一个包可以提供特定算法或数据结构的实现。


Stacks are focused on release products, so they usually organize packages together that provide an aggregate functionality, like a navigation system. Stacks are also organized by software development concerns: they often collect code that is co-developed and has interdependent APIs. Releasing this code together enables shared internal APIs to be changed together within a single release.

> 堆栈的重点是发布产品，因此它们通常会将提供聚合功能的包组织在一起，比如导航系统。堆栈也按照软件开发的关注点进行组织：它们经常收集共同开发的代码，并具有相互依赖的API。将这些代码一起发布可以使共享的内部API在单个发布中一起更改。


While most stacks contain multiple packages, there are several instances of stacks only containing a single package. This type of organization is common with external libraries that are integrated into ROS and also common with packages that are developed in isolation, such as a ROS client library. For example, the `slam_gmapping` stack just contains the `gmapping` package. This demonstrates the awkward naming prefix that is often used to differentiate the stack from the package.

> 大多数堆栈包含多个包，但也有一些只包含一个包的堆栈实例。这种组织方式常用于集成到ROS中的外部库，也常用于孤立开发的包，例如ROS客户端库。例如，`slam_gmapping`堆栈只包含`gmapping`包。这表明了经常用于区分堆栈和包的令人尴尬的命名前缀。


There are also cases where stacks collect packages that either have similar functionality or were co-developed, but are better provided separately. For example, the various driver stacks in ROS collect similar drivers, like `camera_drivers`, and `laser_drivers`. This collection requires users to install many drivers, instead of drivers just for the hardware they have.

> 也有一些情况，堆栈收集具有相似功能或共同开发的包，但最好单独提供。例如，ROS中的各种驱动程序堆栈收集类似的驱动程序，如“camera_drivers”和“laser_drivers”。这种收集需要用户安装许多驱动程序，而不是仅为其具有的硬件安装驱动程序。


One final interesting case is external libraries that wish to provide ROS integration. While these libraries can add a ROS package manifest to their source tree to achieve integration with the build system, they must create an additional level of directory hierarchy to be release-able.

> 最后一个有趣的案例是希望提供ROS集成的外部库。虽然这些库可以在其源树中添加ROS软件包清单以实现与构建系统的集成，但它们必须创建一个额外的目录层次结构才能发布。


Unary stacks enable a filesystem directory to be treated as both a package and stack. This will alleviate pain felt by developers when the package and stack organizational levels overlap and also make it easier for external library maintainers to release code for use in a ROS system.

> 可统一堆栈使文件系统目录可以同时作为包和堆栈来处理。当包和堆栈的组织级别重叠时，这将减轻开发人员所感受到的痛苦，并且也使外部库维护者更容易发布用于ROS系统中的代码。

# Specification

*Unary stacks* are defined to be directories that contain both a *stack manifest*[^1] and *package manifest*[^2]. With respect to ROS command-line tools, the directory is both a stack and a package. The stack contains a single package, which shares the same name.

## Stack version

The stack version number is currently contained the `CMakeLists.txt` file. For example, this indicate a stack at version 1.2.5:

```
rosbuild_make_distribution(1.2.5)
```

For backwards compatibility, we will continue to support the `rosbuild_make_distribution()` macro as a version number source.

In order to support external libraries that cannot use this CMake macro, this REP introduces a `<version>` tag in the stack manifest:

```
<stack>
   <version>1.2.5</version>
   ...
</stack>
```


The `<version>` tag has a single text element, which is interpreted to be the version number of the stack. Surrounding whitespace in this text element is stripped.

> `<version>` 标签只有一个文本元素，它被解释为堆栈的版本号。这个文本元素中的空白会被去除。

The `<version>` tag has precedence over the `rosbuild_make_distribution()` macro.

## Affected tools and libraries

The following tools are expected to be directly impacted by this change and will require testing:

> - `rospack`
> - `rosstack`
> - `rosdep`
> - `roscreate-stack`
> - `rosmake`
> - `rosdoc`

The following Python libraries will be updated to follow the definition of unary stacks:

> - `roslib.packages`
> - `roslib.stacks`
> - `roslib.manifest`
> - `roslib.stack_manifest`

The following ROS wiki documentation macros will be updated to represent unary stacks:

> - `StackHeader()`
> - `PackageHeader()`

For ease of deployment, `StackHeader()` and `PackageHeader()` will treat unary stacks the same and represent both stack and package metadata.

## Releasing a unary stack


The largest required change is to the ROS release system[^3]. Previously, stacks and packages each have a `CMakeLists.txt` file that handles the required release behavior. In order to simplify combining these two entities, stacks will no longer be built by CMake. Instead, the release scripts will perform the necessary release packaging.

> 最大的必需变更是对ROS发行系统[^3]的更改。以前，堆栈和包括一个`CMakeLists.txt`文件来处理所需的发行行为。为了简化这两个实体的结合，将不再通过CMake构建堆栈。相反，发行脚本将执行必要的发行打包。

## Additional rosmake modifications


The behavior of `rosmake <stack-name>` will be modify to mean, \"rosmake all the packages in this stack, as well as all of the stacks this stack depends on.\" Previously, the behavior was, \"rosmake all of the packages in this stack.\"

> `rosmake <stack-name>`的行为将被修改为意味着：“编译这个堆栈中的所有软件包，以及它所依赖的所有堆栈。”之前，行为是“编译这个堆栈中的所有软件包”。

# Rationale

## Unary stacks vs. bare packages


One of the main alternatives to unary stacks is to release bare packages. This creates issues relating to separation of concerns. Stacks contain information about how a body of code is released, whereas packages contain information about how code is built. Keeping this information semantically separate simplifies and clarifies the toolchain. For similar reasons, the specified implementation is much more straightforward as the existing toolchain can maintain the existing semantics of stacks and packages and not have to introduce a new hybrid semantic.

> 一个主要的替代单一堆栈的方法是发布裸套件。这会引起关于职责分离的问题。堆栈包含有关如何发布代码集的信息，而套件包含有关如何构建代码的信息。将这些信息语义上分离可以简化和澄清工具链。出于类似的原因，指定的实现也更加直接，因为现有的工具链可以维护堆栈和套件的现有语义，而不必引入新的混合语义。

## rosmake changes


The changes to the behavior in rosmake are necessitated by the desire to release empty stacks. Empty stacks are a convenient mechanism for migrating to unary stacks and are also a useful mechanism for declaring \'meta stacks\' that simply aggregate multiple stacks. For the purposes of migrating to unary stacks, empty stacks are used to declare a dependency on the new unary stack. For example, the `simulator_stage` stack will still exist in ROS Electric, but it will be empty and declare a dependency on the `stage` stack.

> 改变rosmake行为的原因是为了发布空堆叠。空堆叠是迁移到单一堆叠的便利机制，也是声明“元堆叠”的有用机制，元堆叠仅仅汇集多个堆叠。为了迁移到单一堆叠，空堆叠用于声明对新单一堆叠的依赖关系。例如，`simulator_stage`堆叠仍将存在于ROS Electric中，但它将是空的，并声明对`stage`堆叠的依赖关系。

# Deployment


Unary stacks are targeted at the ROS Electric Emys release. We anticipate migrating a small number of stacks to use the unary stack system, but our priority is the stability of the distribution release.

> 我们针对ROS Electric Emys发布版本计划采用一元堆栈系统。我们预计会将少量堆栈转换到使用一元堆栈系统，但我们的优先考虑是发布版本的稳定性。

# Backwards Compatibility

Unary stacks are not backwards compatible with previous ROS distributions and will not be released into ROS Diamondback.


In order to minimize the impact to stack dependencies, we will release shell stacks for any stacks that are migrated to use the unary stack system. For example, when `camera_drivers` are separated into individual unary stacks for each driver, we will release a new `camera_drivers` stack that depends on each of these stacks. Support for these shell stacks will be maintained for a single ROS distribution release, then removed.

> 为了最小化对堆栈依赖性的影响，我们将为任何迁移到使用单一堆栈系统的堆栈发布壳堆栈。例如，当`camera_drivers`被分割成单独的单一堆栈时，我们将发布一个新的`camera_drivers`堆栈，它依赖于这些堆栈中的每一个。将为这些壳堆栈维护单个ROS发行版本，然后移除。

> 回复：141 标题：ROS 分发文件 作者：Dirk Thomas 状态：最终 类型：标准跟踪 内容类型：text/x-rst 创建日期：2013 年 12 月 18 日 发布历史：2013 年 12 月 18 日

# Abstract


This REP specifies a set of files which define ROS distributions and facilitate the building, packaging, testing and documenting process. The intention is to formalize the existing infrastructure and simplify hosting of (potentially customized) ROS buildfarms. This REP is a revised version of REP 137[^1].

> 这份REP指定了一组文件，用于定义ROS发行版并促进构建、打包、测试和文档化过程。其目的是将现有基础设施正式化，并简化（可能定制）ROS构建农场的托管。本REP是REP 137[^1]的修订版本。

# Motivation


A ROS distribution consists of numerous software packages maintained by various contributors forming a coherent set. Until now there was only one buildfarm responsible for running unit tests and generating Debian packages for various Ubuntu versions and no formal description of the semantics of the files used in that process was given so far. Expanding the current capabilities to support other platforms and architectures will be important extensions.

> 一个ROS发行版由许多软件包组成，这些软件包由各种贡献者维护，形成一个连贯的集合。到目前为止，只有一个构建农场负责运行单元测试并为各种Ubuntu版本生成Debian软件包，并且迄今为止没有给出该过程中使用的文件的语义的正式描述。扩展当前功能以支持其他平台和架构将是重要的扩展。


This REP aims to specify all information and file formats necessary to release and package ROS distributions for various platforms and architectures. By formalizing these data structures it should be enabled to:

> 此REP旨在为各种平台和架构发布和打包ROS分发指定所有信息和文件格式。通过正式化这些数据结构，应该能够：

- release packages using bloom[^2] for all targeted platforms
- build binary packages for selected platforms and architectures
- run unit tests on selected platforms and architectures
- generation documentation

The use cases this REP is designed to address are:


1. simplify the setup of a buildfarm which builds, tests and documents a ROS distribution, i.e. building, testing and documenting individual ROS distributions on separate buildfarms

> 简化构建农场的设置，以构建、测试和记录ROS发布，即在单独的构建农场上构建、测试和记录各个ROS发布。
2. enable building binary packages for (experimental) platforms and architectures
3. enable building binary packages of custom packages on top of the existing ROS distributions for publicly or privately hosted projects

# Design requirements

The information formalized in this REP is used in five separate processes:

- releasing a package (This is the process of exporting upstream source and generating platform specific build files specific meta-information)
- building binary packages for a specific platform and architecture
- running automated tests
- running documentation jobs
- checking out packages/repositories and their recursive dependencies from release repositories as well as source repositories


There should be a single configuration which contains (or references) all information required to run the above processes. The configuration must be easily readable and editable by both humans as well as machines and be extendable with future functionality.

> 应该有一个单独的配置，其中包含（或引用）所有运行上述进程所需的信息。该配置必须易于由人类和机器读取和编辑，并可以扩展未来的功能。

The set of packages for which to build binary packages must be configurable for each platform and architecture.


The release process should stay independent of the build process. The testing can be performed on either the upstream source or on the released tarball (depending on if the upstream source contains enough information to run the test suite). The build process can only work on released packages.

> 发布过程应独立于构建过程。测试可以在上游源代码上或已发布的 tarball 上进行（取决于上游源代码是否包含足够的信息来运行测试套件）。构建过程只能在发布的软件包上运行。

Each configuration file must contain a label which identifies the semantics of the file as well as a version number to enable future format updates.

It must be possible to unambiguously correlate source and release repositories of the same packages.

# Rationale


A single configuration containing or referencing all required information allows for a single entry point for automated processing in the above mentioned processes.

> 一个包含或引用所有所需信息的单一配置，可为上述流程中的自动处理提供单一入口。


Specifying individual subsets of packages per platform and architecture is necessary since not all released packages can and should be build on all platforms and architectures.

> 按照平台和架构来指定每个独立的软件包子集是必要的，因为不是所有发布的软件包都能够并且应该在所有平台和架构上构建。


The information for the various processes could be separated from each other to ease customizing individual processes. But then it would not be reliably possible to correlate entries from different processes. E.g. a released repo can not be unambiguously correlated to a source repository. Especially for tools like rosinstall_generator this would be valuable in order to enable certain features.

> 可以将各个过程的信息分开，以便自定义各个过程。但是这样就无法可靠地将不同过程的条目相关联。例如，无法明确将发布的存储库与源存储库相关联。特别是对于像rosinstall_generator这样的工具，这将有助于实现某些功能。

# Specification


This REP gives a formal specification for the files that are used for that. Currently the information about the repositories is stored in three different files: \* release.yaml \* source.yaml \* doc.yaml

> 这个REP为使用的文件提供了一个正式的规范。目前，存储有关存储库的信息的文件有三个：\* release.yaml \* source.yaml \* doc.yaml


In order to correlate them reliably this information will be stored in a single distribution.yaml file. For each repository the content from the separate files is nested under a common repository entry in the new distribution file.

> 为了可靠地相关联它们，这些信息将存储在单个distribution.yaml文件中。对于每个存储库，来自单独文件的内容将在新的分发文件中嵌套在一个共同的存储库条目下。


The subfolder information for each package is being dropped. Since the location within the repository might be different for release/source/doc it would need to be maintained separately for each of them. Currently the package.xml is only fetched for released packages and then it is retrieved from the known location in the release repository.

> 每个包的子文件夹信息正在被丢弃。由于发行/源/文档中的位置可能会有所不同，因此需要分别为每个位置维护。目前，只有已发布的包才能获取package.xml，然后从发行存储库中的已知位置获取它。


The status information is not specific to the release repository anymore but applies to the source and doc repository as well. This allows for annotating the status of repositories and packages even if they are not released.

> 状态信息不再特定于发布仓库，也适用于源和文档仓库。这样即使仓库和包没有发布，也可以对其状态进行注释。

All current information can be converted into the new format using a script in the reference implementation.

## File format

Files use YAML 1.1 for the sake of human and machine readability and write-ability. As a good practice, the files should contain a header such as:

```
%YAML 1.1
# ROS index|distribution|release-build|source-build|doc-build file
# see REP 141: https://ros.org/reps/rep-0141.html
---
```

## Index file


The index file acts as a single configuration entrypoint which lists all available ROS distributions, along with references pointing to further process specific information. The references can be either relative to the index file or absolute.

> 索引文件充当单个配置入口点，列出所有可用的ROS发行版，以及指向进一步特定进程信息的引用。引用可以是相对于索引文件的，也可以是绝对的。

The information stored in the index file is:

- distributions: a list of ROS distributions

  For each distribution further information are referenced:

  - distribution: reference to the distribution file
  - release_builds: list of references to the release-build files used to build the binary packages

  - release_cache: reference to a release cache. Whether this field is a dictionary, a list or a scalar is left as an implementation detail. The following examples will assume that the implementation necessitates an url.

> - release_cache：引用发布缓存。实现是字典、列表还是标量，留作实现细节。以下示例将假定实现需要一个URL。
  - source_builds: list of references to the source-build files used to run the tests
  - doc_builds: list of references to the doc-build files used to run the documentation

- type: must be \'index\'
- version: version number, this REP describes version 2 (instead of version 1 described in REP 137[^3])

## Example

An index file referencing multiple distribution with their release, source and doc files and their corresponding build files.

```
%YAML 1.1
# ROS index file
# see REP 141: https://ros.org/reps/rep-0141.html
---
distributions:
  groovy:
    distribution: groovy/distribution.yaml
    release_builds: [groovy/release-build-ubuntu.yaml, releases/release-build-arm.yaml]
    release_cache: http://www.example.com/groovy-cache
    source_builds: [groovy/source-build.yaml]
    doc_builds: [groovy/doc-build.yaml]
  hydro:
    ...
type: index
version: 2
```

## Distribution file

A distribution is identified by the code name of the ROS distribution in the index file. Each distribution file contains the following information:

- repositories: a list of repositories which are identified by unique names

  - release: all release repository related information are nested under this key

    - url: the URL of the release git repository The URL must be anonymously readable and (with the appropriate credentials) writable.
    - version: version number for which packages are released. This can be a tag, branch or hash.
    - packages: an optional list of package names. If no package is specified, one package with the name of the repository is assumed.
    - tags: a dict of tags which can be used by tools like bloom and the rosinstall generator, preventing the need for those tools to guess about tags in release repositories, e.g. \'release/package/1.2.3\' vs \'release/groovy/package/1.2.3-4\'. This provides a useful future proofing mechanism for tools which use tags in the release repository, rather than guessing the format of the tags they can infer them directly from the tag templates.

      - _tag_name {release, debian, etc\...}_: Format of tags are strings with {template_variables} e.g. \'release/groovy/{package}/{version}\' A non-exhaustive list of possible template tags:

        - package - name of the package which this release tag corresponds
        - version - full version of the package being released, e.g. 1.2.3-4
        - upstream_version - upstream version of package being released, e.g. 1.2.3
        - debian_distro - target debian distro codename
        - debian_package_name - name of package, with any prefix and sanitized for debian

        The only required tag_name is \'release\', others like \'debian\' are optional.

  - source: all source repository related information are nested under this key
    - type: the type of SCM in use. Typically \'git\', \'svn\'\...
    - url: the URL of the source repository The URL must be anonymously readable.
    - version: For git and hg this is the tag, branch or hash to be checked out. For svn the version should not be set since the branch/tag is encoded in the url.
  - doc: all doc repository related information are nested under this key
    - type: the type of SCM in use. Typically \'git\', \'svn\'\...
    - url: the URL of the source repository The URL must be anonymously readable.
    - version: For git and hg this is the tag, branch or hash to be checked out. For svn the version should not be set since the branch/tag is encoded in the url.
    - blacklist_packages: an optional list of package names which should not be documented. (default: \[\])
    - depends: list of repository names. Other repositories to perform cross referencing in the documentation. This is only necessary if the packages from the dependent repositories are not released. (default: \[\])

  - status: defines the status of the packages of the repository. Can be one of the following: `developed`, `maintained`, `unmaintained`, `end-of-life`

> - 状态：定义存储库中包的状态。可以是以下之一：`developed`，`maintained`，`unmaintained`，`end-of-life`。

  - status_description: an optional field describing in a short sentence the current status of the repository. For example detailing the reason for EOL and the recommended upgrade path.

> 一个可选字段，用简短的句子描述库的当前状态。例如详细说明终止支持的原因以及推荐的升级路径。

  - status_per_package: an optional list of package names. For each package name a dictionary with the following optional keys allows to override the status information:

> - status_per_package：可选的包名列表。对于每个包名，具有以下可选键的字典可以覆盖状态信息：
    - status: overrides the repository-wide status
    - status_description: overrides the repository-wide status description


- release_platforms: a dict of target platforms for which packages are released. Each key contains the OS name while the value is a list of OS code names. These OS names and OS code names are determined by _rospkg.os_detect_[^4]. Each target platform will result in a different bloom release.

> `- release_platforms：一个用于发布软件包的目标平台字典。每个键包含操作系统名称，而值是操作系统代码名列表。这些操作系统名称和操作系统代码名由_rospkg.os_detect_[^4]确定。每个目标平台都会产生不同的Bloom发布。`
- type: must be \'distribution\'
- version: version number, this REP describes version 1

**Example**: A distribution file listing repositories and the release platforms. All changes to REP 137 are commented on inline.

## Release build file

A release build file contains the information necessary to build packages of the packages specified in the release file:


- package_whitelist: a list of package names to build. If this is omitted all packages specified in the release part of the distribution file are built. Any upstream packages are implicitly included.

> - package_whitelist：要构建的软件包名称列表。如果省略，则会构建发行部分分发文件中指定的所有软件包。上游软件包隐式包含在内。

- package_blacklist: a list of package names excluded from build. If this is omitted no packages are excluded. Any downstream package are implicitly excluded. The blacklist overrides the whitelist.

> - 包黑名单：一个不参与构建的包名列表。如果省略，则不排除任何包。任何下游包都会被隐式排除。黑名单会覆盖白名单。
- notifications: An optional section to configure email notifications.
  - emails: a list of email addresses to which to send all notification emails. (default: empty)
  - maintainers: a boolean flag used to enable email notification to listed maintainers. (default: false)
  - committers: a boolean flag used to enable email notification to committers. (default: false)

- targets: a nested dict of targets for which packages are built. The first level key contains the OS name. The second level key contains the OS code name. The third level key contains the CPU architecture. The OS names and OS code names specified must be listed as a release platform in the corresponding distribution file. Each level can contain a key [\_config]{.title-ref} which can contain a dict with arbitrary data. These configurations can be used to specify target specific information (e.g. [apt_target_repository]{.title-ref} or [yum_repository]{.title-ref}).

> 目标：一个嵌套的字典，用于构建软件包。第一级键包含操作系统名称。第二级键包含操作系统代码名称。第三级键包含CPU架构。指定的操作系统名称和操作系统代码名称必须列为相应发行版本的发行平台。每个级别都可以包含一个具有任意数据的[\_config]{.title-ref}键。这些配置可用于指定特定于目标的信息（例如[apt_target_repository]{.title-ref}或[yum_repository]{.title-ref}）。
- jenkins_url: the url to the associated Jenkins master
- jenkins_sourcedeb_job_timeout: the timeout in minutes for the sourcedeb jobs (optional).
- jenkins_binarydeb_job_timeout: the timeout in minutes for the binarydeb jobs (optional).

- sync: specify the criteria that need to be fulfilled for packages to be synced. Any of the following options can be set and all of them must be fulfilled:

> - 同步：指定要同步的软件包的标准。可以设置以下任何一项，并且所有这些都必须满足：
  - package_count: integer. Specifies how many packages need to be successfully built to perform a sync. (default: 0)
  - packages: list of package names. All the packages of this list must be successfully built to perform a sync. (default: \[\])
- type: must be \'release-build\'
- version: version number, this REP describes version 1, since the specification is the same as in REP 137

**Example**: A build file selecting a subset of packages from the release part of a distribution file and specifying the platforms and architectures.

```
%YAML 1.1
# ROS release-build file
# see REP 141: https://ros.org/reps/rep-0141.html

  maintainers: true
  committers: false
targets:

    apt_target_repository: http://archives.example.com/ros
    apt_mirrors: [http://archives.example.com/ros, http://packages.foo.org/repos/example]

      armel:
jenkins_url: http://jenkins.example.com:8080
sync:
  packages: [ros_tutorials]
type: release-build
version: 1
```

## Release cache file


Collection of all meta information of the ROS distribution, including all the information from the package.xml files. The cache must reference the release file and store a hash of the release file it was build from to be able to detect if the cache is invalid. The format of that cache is considered an implementation detail and is not specified in this REP.

> 收集ROS发行版的所有元信息，包括所有来自package.xml文件的信息。缓存必须引用发行文件并存储它构建的发行文件的哈希值，以便能够检测缓存是否无效。该缓存的格式被认为是实现细节，本REP中未指定。

## Source build file


The source build file uses a specification similar to the release build file, but does not have sync information. Also the white- and blacklist is on a repository level and does not consider any kind of dependencies.

> 源构建文件使用的规范类似于发布构建文件，但没有同步信息。此外，白名单和黑名单是在存储库级别上，不考虑任何类型的依赖关系。


- repository_whitelist: a list of repository names to build. If this is omitted all repositories specified in the source part of the distribution file are built.

> - repository_whitelist：要构建的仓库名称列表。如果省略，则会构建分发文件中指定的所有仓库。

- repository_blacklist: a list of repository names excluded from build. If this is omitted no repositories are excluded. The blacklist overrides the whitelist.

> `- 仓库黑名单：一个被排除在构建之外的仓库名称列表。如果省略此项，则不排除任何仓库。黑名单优先于白名单。`
- notifications: as specified for the release build file.
- targets: as specified for the release build file.
- jenkins_url: as specified for the release build file.
- jenkins_job_timeout: the timeout in minutes for each job (optional).
- type: must be \'source-build\'
- version: version number, this REP describes version 1, since the specification is the same as in REP 137

## Documentation build file

The documentation build file uses a specification similar to the source build file.


- repository_whitelist: a list of repository names to build. If this is omitted all repositories specified in the doc part of the distribution file are built.

> - repository_whitelist：要构建的仓库名称列表。如果省略，则构建发行文件doc部分指定的所有仓库。

- repository_blacklist: a list of repository names excluded from build. If this is omitted no repositories are excluded. The blacklist overrides the whitelist.

> - repository_blacklist：要排除的存储库名称列表。如果省略，则不排除任何存储库。黑名单优先于白名单。
- notifications: as specified for the source build file.
- targets: as specified for the source build file. But the list of targets must only have one entry.
- jenkins_url: as specified for the source build file.
- jenkins_job_timeout: the timeout in minutes for each job (optional).
- doc_tag_index_repository: a repository storing the tag index
  - type: the type of SCM in use. Must be \'git\'
  - url: the URL of the release git repository The URL must be writable (with the appropriate credentials).
  - version: This is the branch to be checked out and committed to.
- type: must be \'doc-build\'
- version: version number, this REP describes version 1, since the specification is the same as in REP 137

## Reference implementation


This REP is to be implemented in version 0.3 of the Python module _rosdistro_. This module will serve as a reference implementation for this REP. Any ROS tool requesting information defined in this REP should use this reference API implementation.

> 这个REP将在Python模块_rosdistro_的0.3版本中实施。该模块将作为此REP的参考实现。任何请求此REP中定义信息的ROS工具都应使用此参考API实现。

# Compatibility issues


To leverage the new file format additional API will be introduced (e.g. \'rosdistro.get_distribution_file()\'). The existing API to access the previously separated release/source/doc repositories will still be available and return the information from the new distribution file.

> 为了利用新的文件格式，将引入额外的API（例如'rosdistro.get_distribution_file()'）。仍然可以使用现有的API访问以前分离的发布/源/文档存储库，并从新的分发文件中返回信息。


As soon as the new version of \'rosdistro\' is released the \'ros/rosdistro\' repository[^5] is being updated to the new format (for Groovy and higher). Any client accessing trying to access the data with an old \'rosdistro\' version will get an error message like this:

> 当新版本的'rosdistro'发布时，'ros/rosdistro'存储库[^5]将更新到新格式（适用于Groovy及更高版本）。任何使用旧版本'rosdistro'访问数据的客户端都会收到类似这样的错误消息：

```
Unable to handle 'index' format version '1', please update rosdistro
```

## Affected tools

For all tools it must be ensured that the used API of rosdistro (even if deprecated) is still working flawlessly:

- bloom[^6]
- buildfarm
- jenkins_scripts
- jenkins_tools
- prerelease_website
- rosdep[^7]
- rosinstall_gen
- rosinstall_generator
- roslocate[^8]


After this REP has been deployed \'rosinstall_generator\' can be modified to enable not only checking out released packages but also source repositories.

> 在部署了这个REP之后，可以修改'rosinstall_generator'以不仅检出已发布的软件包，还能检出源代码仓库。


The other tools should be updated in the future to use the newly introduced rather then the deprecated API. After some migration period the deprecated API might be removed from \'rosdistro\'.

> 未来应更新其他工具以使用新引入的而不是弃用的API。在一段迁移期之后，弃用的API可能会从'rosdistro'中移除。

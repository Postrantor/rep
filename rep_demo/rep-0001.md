# What is a REP?


REP stands for ROS Enhancement Proposal. A REP is a design document providing information to the ROS community, or describing a new feature for ROS or its processes or environment. The REP should provide a concise technical specification of the feature and a rationale for the feature.

> REP代表ROS增强建议。REP是一份设计文档，为ROS社区提供信息，或描述ROS或其过程或环境的新功能。REP应提供功能的简明技术规范和功能的理由。


We intend REPs to be the primary mechanisms for proposing new features, for collecting community input on an issue, and for documenting the design decisions that have gone into ROS. The REP author is responsible for building consensus within the community and documenting dissenting opinions.

> 我们打算让REP成为提出新特性、收集社区对某个问题的意见以及记录ROS设计决策的主要机制。REP作者负责在社区内建立共识，并记录异议意见。


Because the REPs are maintained as text files in a versioned repository, their revision history is the historical record of the feature proposal[^1].

> 由于REPs以版本化存储库中的文本文件的形式维护，它们的修订历史是功能建议的历史记录[^1]。


The REP process is based on the Python PEP process. We are thankful to the Python PEP contributors for providing a process, tools, and templates for community participation in a design process.

> REP流程基于Python PEP流程。我们感谢Python PEP的贡献者为社区参与设计流程提供了流程、工具和模板。


This initial document is based on a search-and-replace of PEP 1 by Barry Warsaw, Jeremy Hylton, David Goodger. Over time, it will incorporate ROS-specific changes to this process. The Author field of this document has been changed in order to denote reponsibility for maintenance, not credit for original authorship.

> 这个初始文件是基于Barry Warsaw、Jeremy Hylton和David Goodger对PEP 1的搜索替换。随着时间的推移，它将纳入ROS特定的过程更改。本文档的作者字段已更改，以表示维护责任，而非原始作者的署名权。

# REP Types


There are three kinds of REP:

> 有三种REP：


1. A **Standards Track** REP describes a new feature or implementation for ROS.

> 一个**标准跟踪**REP描述了ROS的新特性或实现。

2. An **Informational** REP describes a ROS design issue, or provides general guidelines or information to the ROS community, but does not propose a new feature. Informational REPs do not necessarily represent a ROS community consensus or recommendation, so users and implementors are free to ignore Informational REPs or follow their advice.

> 2. 信息 REP 描述了ROS设计问题，或者向ROS社区提供了一般的指导或信息，但不提出新特性。信息 REP 不一定代表ROS社区的共识或建议，因此用户和实施者可以忽略信息 REP 或者遵循它们的建议。

3. A **Process** REP describes a process surrounding ROS, or proposes a change to (or an event in) a process. Process REPs are like Standards Track REPs but apply to areas other than the ROS language itself. They may propose an implementation, but not to ROS\'s codebase; they often require community consensus; unlike Informational REPs, they are more than recommendations, and users are typically not free to ignore them. Examples include procedures, guidelines, changes to the decision-making process, and changes to the tools or environment used in ROS development. Any meta-REP is also considered a Process REP.

> 3. 一个“过程”REP描述了一个围绕ROS的过程，或者提出了对（或事件中的）过程的更改。过程REP就像标准跟踪REP，但适用于除ROS语言本身以外的领域。它们可能提出一个实施方案，但不是ROS的代码库；它们通常需要社区共识；不像信息REP，它们不仅仅是建议，用户通常不能自由忽略它们。例子包括程序、指南、决策过程的更改，以及用于ROS开发的工具或环境的更改。任何元REP也被视为过程REP。

# REP Work Flow


The REP editors assign REP numbers and change their status. Please post all REP-related email to the General section of [discourse.ros.org](https://discourse.ros.org). Also see [REP Editor Responsibilities & Workflow](#rep-editor-responsibilities-workflow) below.

> 编辑者负责分配REP编号并更改其状态。请将所有与REP相关的电子邮件发布到[discourse.ros.org](https://discourse.ros.org)的“General”部分。另请参见下面的“REP编辑器职责和工作流程”。


The REP process begins with a new idea for ROS. It is highly recommended that a single REP contain a single key proposal or new idea. Small enhancements or patches often don\'t need a REP and can be injected into the ROS development work flow with a patch submission to the REP [issue tracker](https://github.com/ros-infrastructure/rep/issues). The more focussed the REP, the more successful it tends to be. The REP editor reserves the right to reject REP proposals if they appear too unfocussed or too broad. If in doubt, split your REP into several well-focussed ones.

> REP流程从ROS的新想法开始。强烈建议一个REP只包含一个关键提案或新想法。小的增强或补丁通常不需要REP，可以通过将补丁提交到REP[问题跟踪器](https://github.com/ros-infrastructure/rep/issues)来注入ROS开发流程。REP越集中，它的成功率就越高。REP编辑有权拒绝太不集中或太宽泛的REP提案。如果有疑问，请将REP分成几个非常集中的REP。


Each REP must have a champion \-- someone who writes the REP using the style and format described below, shepherds the discussions in the appropriate forums, and attempts to build community consensus around the idea. The REP champion (a.k.a. Author) should first attempt to ascertain whether the idea is REP-able. Posting to [discourse.ros.org](https://discourse.ros.org) is the best way to go about this.

> 每个 REP 必须有一个冠军-- 使用下面描述的样式和格式编写 REP 的人，在适当的论坛中引导讨论，并尝试在想法周围建立社区共识。REP 冠军（也称作作者）应该首先尝试确定这个想法是否可以作为 REP。发布到[discourse.ros.org](https://discourse.ros.org)是达到这个目的的最佳方式。


Vetting an idea publicly before going as far as writing a REP is meant to save the potential author time. Many ideas have been brought forward for changing ROS that have been rejected for various reasons. Asking the ROS community first if an idea is original helps prevent too much time being spent on something that is guaranteed to be rejected based on prior discussions (searching the internet does not always do the trick). It also helps to make sure the idea is applicable to the entire community and not just the author. Just because an idea sounds good to the author does not mean it will work for most people in most areas where ROS is used.

> 在撰写REP之前，公开审查一个想法旨在为潜在的作者节省时间。许多改变ROS的想法已经因为各种原因而被拒绝。首先向ROS社区询问一个想法是否是原创可以防止花费太多时间在一些基于先前讨论而肯定会被拒绝的事情上（仅通过网络搜索并不总能解决问题）。它还有助于确保想法适用于整个社区，而不仅仅是作者。仅仅因为一个想法对作者来说听起来不错，并不意味着它对大多数使用ROS的地区的大多数人都有效。


Once the champion has asked the ROS community as to whether an idea has any chance of acceptance, a draft REP should be posted to [discourse.ros.org](https://discourse.ros.org). This gives the author a chance to flesh out the draft REP to make properly formatted, of high quality, and to address initial concerns about the proposal.

> 一旦冠军问ROS社区是否有机会接受一个想法，应该将草案REP发布到[discourse.ros.org](https://discourse.ros.org)。这给了作者机会去完善草案REP，使其格式正确，质量高，并解决有关提案的初步担忧。


Following an initial discussion on Discourse, the draft REP should be posted to Discourse as well. The draft must be written in REP style as described below, else it will be sent back without further regard until proper formatting rules are followed.

> 在Discourse上进行初步讨论之后，草案REP也应该发布到Discourse上。草案必须按照下面描述的REP样式书写，否则将不经过进一步考虑就退回，直到遵守正确的格式规则。


If the REP editor approves, he will assign the REP a number, label it as Standards Track, Informational, or Process, give it status \"Draft\", and create and check-in the initial draft of the REP. The REP editor will not unreasonably deny a REP. Reasons for denying REP status include duplication of effort, being technically unsound, not providing proper motivation or addressing backwards compatibility, or not in keeping with the ROS philosophy. The MDFN (Malevolent Dictator for Now, TBD) can be consulted during the approval phase, and is the final arbiter of the draft\'s REP-ability.

> 如果REP编辑批准，他将为REP分配一个编号，将其标记为标准跟踪、信息或流程，将其状态设置为“草案”，并创建并检查初稿。 REP编辑不会无理拒绝REP。拒绝REP状态的原因包括重复努力、技术不稳定、没有提供正确的动机或解决向后兼容性、或与ROS哲学不符。在批准阶段可以咨询MDFN（暂时的恶毒独裁者，待定），它是草案REP能力的最终仲裁者。


As updates are necessary, the REP author can check in new versions if they have GIT commit permissions, or can email new REP versions to the REP editor for committing.

> 更新是必要的，如果REP作者有GIT提交权限，可以检查新版本，或者可以将新的REP版本电子邮件发送给REP编辑进行提交。


Standards Track REPs consist of two parts, a design document and a reference implementation. The REP should be reviewed and accepted before a reference implementation is begun, unless a reference implementation will aid people in studying the REP. Standards Track REPs must include an implementation \-- in the form of code, a patch, or a URL to same \-- before it can be considered Final.

> 标准跟踪 REP 由两部分组成，一个设计文档和一个参考实现。除非参考实现将有助于人们研究 REP，否则应在开始参考实现之前先审查并接受 REP。标准跟踪 REP 在被视为最终版之前必须包含一个实现，以代码、补丁或 URL 的形式。


REP authors are responsible for collecting community feedback on a REP before submitting it for review. However, wherever possible, long open-ended discussions on public mailing lists should be avoided. Strategies to keep the discussions efficient include: setting up a separate SIG mailing list for the topic, having the REP author accept private comments in the early design phases, setting up a wiki page, etc. REP authors should use their discretion here.

> REP作者负责在提交审查前收集社区对REP的反馈。但是，应尽量避免在公共邮件列表上进行长期的开放式讨论。保持讨论有效的策略包括：为该主题设立一个单独的SIG邮件列表，让REP作者在早期设计阶段接受私人意见，设置一个wiki页面等。REP作者应当在此处自行斟酌。


Once the authors have completed a REP, they must inform the REP editor that it is ready for review. REPs are reviewed by the MDFN and his chosen consultants, who may accept or reject a REP or send it back to the author(s) for revision. For a REP that is pre-determined to be acceptable (e.g., it is an obvious win as-is and/or its implementation has already been checked in) the MDFN may also initiate a REP review, first notifying the REP author(s) and giving them a chance to make revisions.

> 一旦作者完成了一个REP，他们必须通知REP编辑已准备好进行审查。 REP由MDFN及其选定的顾问审查，他们可以接受或拒绝REP或将其退回给作者进行修改。 对于已经预先确定为可接受的REP（例如，它是一个明显的赢家，并且/或其实施已经被检查），MDFN还可以发起REP审查，首先通知REP作者并给他们一个机会进行修改。


For a REP to be accepted it must meet certain minimum criteria. It must be a clear and complete description of the proposed enhancement. The enhancement must represent a net improvement. The proposed implementation, if applicable, must be solid and must not complicate existing libraries unduly. Finally, a proposed enhancement must be \"ROSonic\". (However, \"ROSonic\" is an imprecise term; it may be defined as whatever is acceptable to ROS Developers. This logic is intentionally circular.)

> 要被接受的REP必须满足一定的最低标准。它必须是对提议的增强的清晰和完整的描述。该增强必须代表净改善。如果适用，所提出的实施必须是坚实的，不能过度复杂化现有的库。最后，提出的增强必须是“ROSonic”的。（但是，“ROSonic”是一个不精确的术语；它可以被定义为ROS开发人员接受的任何东西。这个逻辑是有意的环路。）


Once a REP has been accepted, the reference implementation must be completed. When the reference implementation is complete and accepted by the MDFN, the status will be changed to \"Final\".

> 一旦REP被接受，参考实现必须完成。当参考实现完成并被MDFN接受时，状态将被更改为“最终”。


A REP can also be assigned status \"Deferred\". The REP author or editor can assign the REP this status when no progress is being made on the REP. Once a REP is deferred, the REP editor can re-assign it to draft status.

> 一个REP也可以被指定为“推迟”的状态。当REP没有取得任何进展时，REP作者或编辑可以将其分配此状态。一旦REP被推迟，REP编辑可以将其重新分配到草稿状态。


A REP can also be \"Rejected\". Perhaps after all is said and done it was not a good idea. It is still important to have a record of this fact.

> 一个REP也可以被拒绝。也许在所有事情都说完后，这不是一个好主意。记录这一事实仍然很重要。


REPs can also be replaced by a different REP, rendering the original obsolete. This is intended for Informational REPs, where version 2 of an API can replace version 1.

> 可以用不同的 REP 替换 REP，使原始 REP 过时。这是为了信息 REP，其中 API 版本 2 可以取代版本 1。


The possible paths of the status of REPs are as follows:

> 以下是REPs状态的可能路径：

![image](rep-0001/rep-0001-1.png)


Some Informational and Process REPs may also have a status of \"Active\" if they are never meant to be completed. E.g. REP 1 (this REP).

> 一些信息和处理REP可能也有“活跃”的状态，如果它们从来没有被完成的话。例如：REP 1（这个REP）。

# What belongs in a successful REP?


Each REP should have the following parts:

> 每个REP应该具备以下部分：


1. Preamble \-- RFC 822 style headers containing meta-data about the REP, including the REP number, a short descriptive title (limited to a maximum of 44 characters), the names, and optionally the contact info for each author, etc.

> 1. 序言--RFC 822样式的标头，包含关于REP的元数据，包括REP编号、简短的描述性标题（最多44个字符）、每位作者的名字，可选的是联系信息等等。

2. Abstract \-- a short (\~200 word) description of the technical issue being addressed.

> 摘要--对所解决的技术问题的简短（约200字）描述。

3. Copyright/public domain \-- Each REP must either be explicitly labelled as placed in the public domain (see this REP as an example) or licensed under the [Open Publication License](http://www.opencontent.org/openpub/).

> 3. 版权/公共领域--每个REP必须明确标记为放入公共领域（参见此REP作为一个例子）或根据[开放出版版许可证](http://www.opencontent.org/openpub/)授权。

4. Specification \-- The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The specification should be detailed enough to allow competing, interoperable implementations for any of the current ROS client libraries, if applicable (roscpp, rospy, roslisp, etc\...).

> 4. 规格--技术规格应该描述任何新功能的语法和语义。规格应该足够详细，以允许当前ROS客户端库（如roscpp，rospy，roslisp等）的竞争性和互操作性实现。

5. Motivation \-- The motivation is critical for REPs that want to change the ROS APIs. It should clearly explain why the existing API specification is inadequate to address the problem that the REP solves. REP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.

> 5. 动机 -- 对于想要改变ROS APIs的REPs来说，动机是至关重要的。它应该清楚地解释为什么现有的API规范不足以解决REP解决的问题。没有足够动机的REP提交可能会被直接拒绝。

6. Rationale \-- The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature is supported in other languages.

> 理由--理由通过描述促使设计的动机以及为什么会采用特定的设计决策来充实规范。它应该描述被考虑过的替代设计以及相关的工作，例如在其他语言中如何支持这个功能。


   The rationale should provide evidence of consensus within the community and discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.

> 理由应提供社区内达成共识的证据，并讨论讨论期间提出的重要反对意见或担忧。

7. Backwards Compatibility \-- All REPs that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing these incompatibilities and their severity. The REP must explain how the author proposes to deal with these incompatibilities. REP submissions without a sufficient backwards compatibility treatise may be rejected outright.

> 所有引入向后不兼容性的 REP 必须包含一个描述这些不兼容性及其严重性的部分。REP 必须解释作者如何提出处理这些不兼容性的方案。如果 REP 提交的向后兼容性处理方案不充分，可能会被拒绝。

8. Reference Implementation \-- The reference implementation must be completed before any REP is given status \"Final\", but it need not be completed before the REP is accepted. It is better to finish the specification and rationale first and reach consensus on it before writing code.

> 参考实现--在任何REP获得“最终”状态之前，必须完成参考实现，但在REP被接受之前不必完成。最好先完成规范和理由，然后在编写代码之前达成共识。


   The final implementation must include test code and documentation.

> 最终实施必须包括测试代码和文档。

# REP Formats and Templates


All REP are expected to be formatted in [reStructuredText](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html) with UTF-8-encoding. [reStructuredText](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html) REPs allow for rich markup that is still quite easy to read. REP 12 contains instructions and a template [^2] for reStructuredText.

> 所有REP期望以[reStructuredText](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html)以UTF-8编码格式进行格式化。[reStructuredText](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html) REP允许丰富的标记，但仍然很容易阅读。REP 12包含reStructuredText的说明和模板[^2]。


There is a Python script that converts REPs to HTML for viewing on the web. reStructuredText REPs are parsed and converted by [Docutils](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/) code called from the script.

> 有一个Python脚本可以将REPs转换为HTML，以便在网上查看。 reStructuredText REPs由[Docutils](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/)代码解析和转换，该代码从脚本中调用。

# REP Header Preamble


Each REP must begin with an RFC 822 style header preamble. The headers must appear in the following order. Headers marked with \"\*\" are optional and are described below. All other headers are required. :

> 每个REP必须以RFC 822样式的预读部分开头。标有“*”的标题是可选的，其说明在下面。所有其他标题都是必需的。

```
REP: <rep number>
Title: <rep title>
Version: <svn version string>
Last-Modified: <svn date string>
Author: <list of authors' real names and optionally, email addrs>
* Discussions-To: <email address>
Status: <Draft | Active | Accepted | Deferred | Rejected |
         Withdrawn | Final | Replaced>
Type: <Standards Track | Informational | Process>
* Content-Type: <text/plain | text/x-rst>
* Requires: <rep numbers>
Created: <date created on, in dd-mmm-yyyy format>
* ROS-Version: <version number>
Post-History: <dates of postings to discourse.ros.org>
* Replaces: <rep number>
* Replaced-By: <rep number>
* Resolution: <url>
```


The Author header lists the names, and optionally the email addresses of all the authors/owners of the REP. The format of the Author header value must be

> 作者标题列出了所有作者/所有者的名字和可选的电子邮件地址。作者标头值的格式必须是

> Random J. User \<<address@dom.ain>\>


if the email address is included, and just

> 如果包含电子邮件地址，

> Random J. User


if the address is not given. For historical reasons the format \"<address@dom.ain> (Random J. User)\" may appear in a REP, however new REPs must use the mandated format above, and it is acceptable to change to this format when REPs are updated.

> 如果没有给出地址。出于历史原因，REP中可能会出现“<address@dom.ain>（Random J. User）”的格式，但是新的REP必须使用上述规定的格式，并且在更新REP时可以改变到这种格式。


If there are multiple authors, each should be on a separate line following RFC 2822 continuation line conventions. Note that personal email addresses in REPs will be obscured as a defense against spam harvesters.

> 如果有多位作者，每位作者应按照RFC 2822续行行约定分列在不同的行上。请注意，REPs中的个人电子邮件地址将被模糊处理，以防止垃圾邮件爬取者。


*Note: The Resolution header is required for Standards Track REPs only. It contains a URL that should point to an email message or other web resource where the pronouncement about the REP is made.*

> *注意：只有标准跟踪 REP 才需要 Resolution 头。它包含一个 URL，指向一封电子邮件信息或其他 web 资源，其中包含关于 REP 的宣言。*


While a REP is in private discussions (usually during the initial Draft phase), a Discussions-To header will indicate the mailing list or URL where the REP is being discussed. No Discussions-To header is necessary if the REP is being discussed privately with the author. Note that email addresses in the Discussions-To header will not be obscured.

> 当REP正处于私下讨论（通常是在初稿阶段）时，Discussions-To标头将指示正在讨论REP的邮件列表或URL。如果REP正在与作者私下讨论，则无需Discussions-To标头。请注意，Discussions-To标头中的电子邮件地址不会被隐藏。


The Type header specifies the type of REP: Standards Track, Informational, or Process.

> 类型标头指定REP类型：标准跟踪、信息或流程。


The format of a REP is specified with a Content-Type header. The only supported values is \"text/x-rst\", which designates reStructuredText encoding (see REP 12[^3]).

> 一个REP的格式由Content-Type头指定。唯一支持的值是“text/x-rst”，它指定重新结构文本编码（参见REP 12[^3]）。


The Created header records the date that the REP was assigned a number, while Post-History is used to record the dates of when new versions of the REP are posted to [https://discourse.ros.org](https://discourse.ros.org). Both headers should be in dd-mmm-yyyy format, e.g. 14-Aug-2010.

> 创建的标题记录了REP被分配编号的日期，而Post-History用于记录REP的新版本被发布到[https://discourse.ros.org](https://discourse.ros.org)的日期。两个标题都应该采用dd-mmm-yyyy格式，例如14-Aug-2010。


Standards Track REPs must have a ROS-Version header which indicates the version/distribution of ROS that the feature will be released with. Informational and Process REPs do not need a ROS-Version header.

> 标准跟踪 REP 必须有一个 ROS-Version 标头，用于指明该功能将发布的 ROS 版本/发行版本。信息和流程 REP 不需要 ROS-Version 标头。


REPs may have a Requires header, indicating the REP numbers that this REP depends on.

> REPs 可以有一个Requires标头，指示该REP所依赖的REP编号。


REPs may also have a Replaced-By header indicating that a REP has been rendered obsolete by a later document; the value is the number of the REP that replaces the current document. The newer REP must have a Replaces header containing the number of the REP that it rendered obsolete.

> REP可以拥有一个Replaced-By头，表明一个REP已被后续文档替代；该值是替代当前文档的REP的编号。新的REP必须拥有一个Replaces头，包含被它替代的REP的编号。

# Auxiliary Files


REPs may include auxiliary files such as diagrams. Such files must be named `rep-XXXX-Y.ext`, where \"XXXX\" is the REP number, \"Y\" is a serial number (starting at 1), and \"ext\" is replaced by the actual file extension (e.g. \"png\").

> REP 可能包括辅助文件，如图表。这些文件必须命名为`rep-XXXX-Y.ext`，其中“XXXX”是REP编号，“Y”是序号（从1开始），“ext”被实际的文件扩展名（如“png”）所取代。

# Reporting REP Bugs, or Submitting REP Updates


How you report a bug, or submit a REP update depends on several factors, such as the maturity of the REP, the preferences of the REP author, and the nature of your comments. For the early draft stages of the REP, it\'s probably best to send your comments and changes directly to the REP author. For more mature, or finished REPs you may want to submit corrections to the REP [issue tracker](https://github.com/ros-infrastructure/rep/issues) so that your changes don\'t get lost. If the REP author is a ROS developer, assign the bug/patch to him, otherwise assign it to the REP editor.

> 如何报告错误或提交REP更新取决于多种因素，例如REP的成熟度、REP作者的偏好以及您的评论的性质。 对于REP的早期草案阶段，最好直接将您的评论和更改发送给REP作者。 对于更成熟或完成的REP，您可能希望将更改提交到REP [问题跟踪器](https://github.com/ros-infrastructure/rep/issues)，以免您的更改丢失。 如果REP作者是ROS开发人员，请将错误/补丁分配给他，否则请将其分配给REP编辑。


When in doubt about where to send your changes, please check first with the REP author and/or REP editor.

> 当你不确定要把你的更改发送到哪里时，请首先与REP作者和/或REP编辑联系。


REP authors who are also ROS committers can update the REPs themselves by using \"git commit/push\" to commit their changes.

> 作为ROS提交者的REP作者可以通过使用“git commit/push”来提交他们的更改来自己更新REP。

# Transferring REP Ownership


It occasionally becomes necessary to transfer ownership of REPs to a new champion. In general, we\'d like to retain the original author as a co-author of the transferred REP, but that\'s really up to the original author. A good reason to transfer ownership is because the original author no longer has the time or interest in updating it or following through with the REP process, or has fallen off the face of the \'net (i.e. is unreachable or not responding to email). A bad reason to transfer ownership is because you don\'t agree with the direction of the REP. We try to build consensus around a REP, but if that\'s not possible, you can always submit a competing REP.

> 有时候需要将REP的所有权转移给新的负责人。一般来说，我们希望保留原作者作为转移REP的共同作者，但这完全取决于原作者。转移所有权的好理由是，原作者不再有时间或兴趣更新它或完成REP流程，或者已经从网络上消失（即无法联系或未回复电子邮件）。转移所有权的坏理由是因为你不同意REP的方向。我们尽量在REP周围建立共识，但如果不可能，你总是可以提交竞争REP。


If you are interested in assuming ownership of a REP, send a message asking to take over, addressed to both the original author and ros-users. If the original author doesn\'t respond to email in a timely manner, the REP editor will make a unilateral decision (it\'s not like such decisions can\'t be reversed :).

> 如果你有兴趣担任REP的所有权，请发送一条消息，请求接管，同时发送给原作者和ros-users。如果原作者没有及时回复电子邮件，REP编辑将会做出单方面的决定（这样的决定并不是不能被撤销的:)。

# REP Editor Responsibilities & Workflow


All REP-related correspondence should be sent (or CC\'d) to \<<ros-users@lists.ros.org>\>.

> 所有与REP相关的通信都应发送（或抄送）至\<<ros-users@lists.ros.org>\>。


For each new REP that comes in an editor does the following:

> 对于每一个新的REP，编辑器都要执行以下操作：


- Read the REP to check if it is ready: sound and complete. The ideas must make technical sense, even if they don\'t seem likely to be accepted.

> 阅读REP以检查其是否准备就绪：声音完整。即使这些想法不太可能被接受，但它们也必须具有技术意义。
- The title should accurately describe the content.

- Edit the REP for language (spelling, grammar, sentence structure, etc.), markup (for reST REPs), code style (examples should match REP 8 & 7).

> 编辑REP的语言（拼写、语法、句子结构等）、标记（针对reST REPs）、代码风格（示例应与REP 8和7相匹配）。


If the REP isn\'t ready, the editor will send it back to the author for revision, with specific instructions.

> 如果REP没有准备好，编辑会把它送回给作者进行修改，并给出具体的指示。


Once the REP is ready for the repository, the REP editor will:

> 一旦REP准备好存储库，REP编辑将：


- Assign a REP number (almost always just the next available number, but sometimes it\'s a special/joke number, like 666 or 3141).

> 分配一个REP编号（通常是下一个可用的编号，但有时会是一个特殊/玩笑编号，比如666或3141）。
- List the REP in REP 0 (in two places: the categorized list, and the numeric list).
- Add the REP to GIT.


  The command to check out a read-only copy of the repository is:

> 检出只读仓库的命令是：

  ```
  git clone https://github.com/ros-infrastructure/rep.git
  ```
- Send email back to the REP author with next steps (post to ros-users).


Updates to existing REPs also come in to <ros-users@lists.ros.org>. Many REP authors are not GIT committers yet, so we do the commits for them.

> 更新到现有的REP也可以发送到<ros-users@lists.ros.org>。许多REP作者还不是GIT提交者，所以我们为他们做提交。


Many REPs are written and maintained by developers with write access to the ROS codebase. The REP editors monitor the rep-commits list for REP changes, and correct any structure, grammar, spelling, or markup mistakes we see.

> 许多REP由具有ROS代码库写入访问权限的开发者编写和维护。REP编辑器监视rep-commits列表以检测REP的变化，并纠正我们看到的任何结构、语法、拼写或标记错误。


The editors don\'t pass judgement on REPs. We merely do the administrative & editorial part. Except for times like this, there\'s relatively low volume.

> 编辑们不会对REPs作出评判。我们只做行政和编辑方面的工作。除了像这样的时候，量相对较低。

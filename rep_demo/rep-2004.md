# Abstract


This REP describes a set of categories meant to convey the quality or maturity of packages in the ROS ecosystem. Inclusion in a category, or quality level, is based on the policies to which a package adheres. The categories address policies about versioning, change control, documentation, testing, dependencies, platform support and security.

> 这个REP描述了一组类别，旨在传达ROS生态系统中包的质量或成熟度。 包含在类别或质量级别中是基于遵循的政策。 这些类别涉及版本控制、变更控制、文档、测试、依赖关系、平台支持和安全等政策。

# Motivation

The purpose of this REP is to provide standard guidelines for evaluating package quality, for both maintainers and consumers.


Package maintainers can use these guidelines to establish and document their own specific policies addressing how their packages achieve certain quality levels.

> 包维护者可以使用这些指南来建立并记录他们自己的特定政策，以描述他们的包如何达到某些质量水平。


Consumers can use the guidelines in the REP, as well as the corresponding policies defined by maintainers, to set expectations on package quality and better evaluate whether a package or its dependencies meet the standards of use in their projects.

> 消费者可以使用REP中的指南以及维护者定义的相应政策，来设定对包质量的期望，并更好地评估某个包及其依赖项是否符合其项目中的使用标准。


The outcome of this REP should be that maintainers who want to evaluate their packages\' quality have looked at each guideline, thought about how their policies address each, adjusted their policies if needed, and then documented their policies and justifications.

> 结果应该是，想要评估自己包质量的维护者已经看过每一个准则，思考了他们的政策如何应对每一个准则，如有需要调整了政策，然后记录下政策和理由。


In turn, the documentation of policies and communication of quality characteristics between maintainers and consumers will improve. By setting these goals and expectations for maintainers and consumers, respectively, the guidelines will also encourage better quality across the ROS ecosystem.

> 随之而来，政策文件的记录和维护者和消费者之间质量特性的沟通将得到改善。通过为维护者和消费者分别设定这些目标和期望，指南也将鼓励ROS生态系统中更好的质量。

## Antigoals

The motivation behind this REP does not include:

- Enforcing quality levels on maintainers
  - No maintainer is required to abide by any of the guidelines in this REP
- Dictating policy implementation specifics necessary to achieve a quality level

  - Maintainers can come up with their own policies or follow an existing set of guidelines for achieving these quality levels; see [Reference Implementation](#reference-implementation) for examples of existing guidelines

> 维护人员可以制定自己的政策或遵循现有的指导方针来达到这些质量水平；参见[参考实现](#reference-implementation)以查看现有指导方针的示例。
  - Policy requirements (which tools to use, specific thresholds, etc.) are *intentionally generic*
- Enforcing the community to approve of policies documented by package maintainers

  - Policies that are skipped or altered with justifications require evaluation by the consumer to see if that reasoning is acceptable for their standards of use

> 被跳过或改变其原因的政策需要消费者进行评估，以确认其原因是否符合他们的使用标准。
  - Enforcement cannot, therefore, be done in an automated fashion in all cases

  - Instead, peer reviewed lists of packages, where maintainers can take their [quality declaration](#reference-implementation) and have their peers verify that their claims/justifications are truthful/reasonable, respectively, can be created

> 代替，可以创建由同行审核的软件包列表，维护者可以在其中拿到自己的[质量声明](#reference-implementation)，并让同行核实他们的声明/理由是真实/合理的。

# Specification

There are five quality levels below, each roughly summarized as:

- Quality Level 1:
  - highest quality level
  - packages that are needed for production systems
  - e.g. `rclcpp`, `urdf`, `tf2`, etc.
- Quality Level 2:
  - high quality packages that are either:
    - on the way to \'Level 1\', or
    - are general solutions used by many people, but are only sometimes used for production systems
  - e.g. `navigation2`, `rosbag2`, etc.
- Quality Level 3:
  - tooling quality packages
  - e.g. `ros2cli`, `rviz`, `rqt`, etc.
- Quality Level 4:
  - demos, tutorials, and experiments
  - e.g. research packages, `demo_nodes_cpp`, `examples_rclcpp_minimal_publisher`, etc.
- Quality Level 5:
  - default quality level
  - e.g. for code that fails to meet requirements in \'Level 4\'


While each quality level will have different requirements, it\'s always possible to overachieve in certain requirements even if other requirements prevent a package from moving up to the next quality level.

> 每个质量水平都有不同的要求，即使其他要求阻止包裹升级到下一个质量水平，也总是有可能在某些要求上超额完成。

## Quality Level 1


This category should be used for packages which are required for a reasonable ROS system in a production environment. These are the packages that remain as requirements for a basic ROS system to run after you remove development tools, build tools, and introspection tools.

> 这个类别应该用于在生产环境中必需的ROS系统的软件包。这些是在您删除开发工具、构建工具和内省工具后仍然作为基本ROS系统运行的要求。


Packages that would not normally fit this description can still be called \'Level 1\'. If there is a need for a particular package in a reasonable production scenario, then that package should be considered for this category as well. However, packages which we consider essential to getting a robot up and running quickly, but perhaps provide a generic solution to a problem should probably not start out as \'Level 1\' due to the high effort required to get a package to \'Level 1\' and maintain it there.

> 包裝通常不符合這個描述的仍然可以被稱為“級別1”。如果在合理的生產情境中有一個特定的包裝需求，那麼該包裝應該也被考慮到這個類別中。然而，我們認為對於快速啟動機器人來說是必須的包裝，但是可能提供一個通用的解決方案，應該不應該一開始就被列為“級別1”，因為將包裝獲得到“級別1”並保持在那裡所需的努力很高。


For example, packages which provide intra-process communication, inter-process communication, generated message runtime code, node lifecycle, etc. should probably all be considered for \'Level 1\'. However, a package which provides pose estimation (like `robot_pose_ekf`) is a generic solution for something that most people need, but is often replaced with a domain specific solution in production, and therefore it should probably not start out as \'Level 1\'. Such a package may upgrade to \'Level 1\' at a later date, if it proves to be a solution that people want to use in their products.

> 例如，提供内部进程通信、跨进程通信、生成消息运行时代码、节点生命周期等的软件包可能应该被考虑作为“第一级”。然而，提供姿态估计（如`robot_pose_ekf`）的软件包是大多数人需要的通用解决方案，但在生产中经常会被特定领域的特定解决方案所取代，因此它可能不应该一开始就作为“第一级”。如果该软件包被证明是人们希望在其产品中使用的解决方案，它可能会在以后升级到“第一级”。


Tools, like `rostopic`, generally do not fall into this category either, but are not categorically excluded. For example, it may be the case that the tool which launches and verifies a ROS graph (`ros2launch`) may need to be considered \'Level 1\' for use in production systems.

> 工具，如`rostopic`，通常不属于此类，但也不是明确排除的。例如，可能需要将启动和验证ROS图（`ros2launch`）的工具视为“一级”，以用于生产系统。

----------------------------------------

: Quality Levels

## Version Policy


The most important thing is to have some version policy which developers may use to anticipate and understand changes to the version of the package. For example, `semver` covers all the important points that a version policy should cover, is well thought out, and is popular in the open source community.

> 最重要的事情是要有一些版本政策，开发人员可以使用它来预测和理解对包的版本的更改。例如，“semver”涵盖了所有版本政策应该涵盖的重要要点，思路清晰，在开源社区中很受欢迎。

The version policy should link public API changes, which may also impact ABI, to changes in the version number.


For the ROS ecosystem, the version policy needs to state that API and ABI will be maintained within a stable ROS distribution. Following `semver`, this means only patch and minor increases are allowed into an existing ROS distribution.

> 对于ROS生态系统，版本政策需要指出API和ABI将在稳定的ROS发行版中维护。遵循“semver”，这意味着只有补丁和次要增量才能进入现有的ROS发行版。

### Public API

The package documentation should state what the public API includes, and/or state what parts of the API are excluded intentionally.


For C++, it\'s assumed that all installed headers are part of the public API, but it\'s acceptable to have parts of the accessible API not be stable. For example, having an \"experimental\" namespace or a \"detail\" namespace which does not adhere to the API and ABI stability rules is allowed, but they must be clearly documented as such. Changes to these excluded APIs, especially something like a \"detail\" namespace, should still not break API or ABI for other public APIs indirectly.

> 对于C++，假设所有安装的头文件都是公共API的一部分，但允许有部分可访问的API不稳定。例如，允许有一个“实验”命名空间或一个不遵守API和ABI稳定规则的“细节”命名空间，但必须清楚地将其文档化。对这些被排除的API的更改，特别是像“细节”命名空间这样的东西，仍然不应破坏其他公共API的API或ABI。


For Python, it\'s more important to explicitly declare which parts of the API are public, because all modules are typically installed and accessible to users. One easy thing to do is to say all of the API is public and therefore API stable, but `impl` or `detail` namespaces can be used if needed, they just need to be clearly documented as \"not public\" and therefore not stable.

> 對於Python來說，明確宣布哪些API是公開的更加重要，因為所有模塊通常都會安裝並且可供用戶訪問。一個簡單的方法是說所有的API都是公開的，因此API是穩定的，但如果需要，可以使用`impl`或`detail`命名空間，只需要清楚地文檔化為“不公開”，因此不穩定即可。


There are also other, non-API, things which should be considered and documented as part of the \"stable interface\" of the package. These could include, but aren\'t limited to, message definitions, command line tools (arguments and output format), ROS names (topic, service, node, etc.), and behaviors of the applications.

> 还有其他的非API的东西也应该被考虑并作为软件包的“稳定接口”的一部分进行文档化。这些可能包括但不限于消息定义，命令行工具（参数和输出格式），ROS 名称（主题，服务，节点等）以及应用程序的行为。


For other languages the details will be different, but the important thing is that the public API be obviously documented, and the public API adheres to a documented and tested API and ABI stability policy, as described in the version policy.

> 其他语言的细节可能会有所不同，但重要的是，公共API明显有文档，并且公共API遵守文档和测试过的API和ABI稳定性政策，如版本政策中所述。

## Feature Documentation


For each feature provided by the public API of the package, or by a tool in the package, there must be corresponding user documentation. The term \"feature\", and the scope of the documentation, is intentionally vague because it\'s difficult to quantitatively measure this metric. In general, for a \'Level 1\' quality package, all of the things a user might do with the package need at least basic documentation or a snippet of code as an example on how to use it. The [roscpp Overview](https://wiki.ros.org/roscpp/Overview) from the ROS 1 wiki is a good example of this kind of documentation.

> 对于包的公共API提供的每个功能，或者包中的工具，都必须有相应的用户文档。“功能”一词以及文档的范围是故意模糊的，因为很难定量衡量这个指标。一般来说，对于一个“等级1”质量的包，用户可以用该包做的所有事情至少需要基本的文档或代码片段作为使用它的示例。ROS 1 wiki上的[roscpp Overview](https://wiki.ros.org/roscpp/Overview)就是这种文档的一个很好的例子。

## Quality Declaration and Claim


Each package claiming a quality level should include a \"quality declaration\" document. This declaration should include a claimed quality level and then should have a section for each of the requirements in that claimed quality level justifying how the package meets each of those requirements.

> 每个声称质量水平的包应包含一份“质量声明”文件。此声明应包含所声称的质量水平，然后应有一个部分，为该声明质量水平的要求辩护，说明该包如何满足这些要求。


Sometimes the justification will be a link to a policy documented in the package itself or it may link to a common policy used by a group of packages. If there is additional evidence that these policies are being followed, that should be included as well, e.g. a link to the coverage statistics for the package to show that coverage is being tracked and maintained. Other times, justification will be an explanation as to why a requirement was not met or does not apply, e.g. if performance tests do not make sense for the package in question, it should be satisfactorily explained.

> 有时，理由可能是指向包本身文档中的政策的链接，也可能是指向一组包共用的政策的链接。如果有其他证据表明这些政策正在被遵守，也应该包括在内，例如指向包的覆盖率统计信息的链接，以表明覆盖率正在跟踪和维护。有时，理由可能是解释为什么某个要求没有得到满足或不适用的说明，例如，如果性能测试对该包没有意义，应该作出令人满意的解释。


There is no enforcement or checking of these claims, but instead it\'s sufficient to present this information to potential users. If the users feel that the justifications are insufficient or incorrect, they can open issues against the repository and resolve it with the maintainers.

> 没有对这些声明的强制执行或检查，但只需向潜在用户提供此信息即可。如果用户认为理由不足或不正确，他们可以对存储库发出问题，并与维护者解决。


There should be one or more communal lists of \'Level 1\' (and maybe \'Level 2\' and \'Level 3\') quality level packages for maintainers to register their packages with to seek peer review. These lists should be modified via change requests (maybe a text document in a repository). This REP will not prescribe how or where these lists should be hosted, but one possibility is an informational REP, continually updated and versioned with each new ROS distribution.

> 应该有一个或多个共同的“第1级”（也可能是“第2级”和“第3级”）质量级别软件包列表，维护者可以注册他们的软件包，以寻求同行评审。这些列表应通过变更请求（可能是存储库中的文本文档）进行修改。本REP不规定这些列表应该在哪里放置，但一种可能性是信息REP，随每个新的ROS发行版而持续更新和版本化。

## Feature Testing and Code Coverage Policy


This policy should aim for a \"high\" coverage standard, but the exact number and rules will vary depending on the package in question. The policy may be influenced by factors like:

> 此政策应以“高”覆盖标准为目标，但具体数字和规则将根据所涉及的包而有所不同。该政策可能受到以下因素的影响：

- what programming languages are being used, and whether or not there are multiple languages in use
- what coverage information is available (statement vs. line vs. branch vs condition/path coverage)
- what strategy is preferred for dealing with difficult-to-reach statements/branches


Tracking and enforcing code coverage statistics is strictly empirical and there are different reasons for using them. Among those reasons is satisfying stakeholders[^1], which is the main goal of requiring a code coverage policy for high quality packages. A set of measurable standards and explanations of the goals they equate to is likely the most convincing method of proving to stakeholders that the package is properly tested.

> 跟踪和执行代码覆盖率统计严格是经验性的，使用它们有不同的原因。其中的原因是满足利益相关者[^1]，这是要求高质量包的代码覆盖率政策的主要目标。一组可衡量的标准和对它们等同于的目标的解释可能是向利益相关者证明该包已经进行了适当测试的最有说服力的方法。


The general recommendation is to have at least line coverage and aim to achieve and maintain a high percentage of coverage (e.g. above 90%). This at least gives you and your stakeholders some confidence that all features have basic tests. Any assurances beyond that would require branch coverage statistics and independent investigation of the tests.

> 一般建议至少有行覆盖率，并努力达到和维持较高的覆盖率（例如90％以上）。这至少可以让您和您的利益相关者有一定的信心，所有功能都有基本的测试。要获得更多保证，需要分支覆盖率统计和对测试的独立调查。

## Performance Testing


There are some cases where performance testing does not make sense to have. For example, it may be a good idea to have performance tests for a code generator (like `rosidl_generator_cpp`), but it is not strictly required since its performance does not affect a runtime production system, and so in that case the package could claim to be \'Level 1\' without performance tests if properly justified in the \"quality declaration\".

> 在有些情况下，性能测试没有意义。例如，对于代码生成器（如`rosidl_generator_cpp`）来说，性能测试可能是一个不错的主意，但由于其性能不会影响运行时生产系统，因此在这种情况下，如果在“质量声明”中得到适当的理由，该软件包可以声称是“第1级”而无需性能测试。


However, if performance is a reasonable concern for use in a production system, then there must be performance tests and they should be used in conjunction with a regression policy which aims to prevent unintended performance degradation. Note, the performance regression policy should not prevent regressions, but instead should aim to detect them and either address them directly, plan to address them in the future, or, when unavoidable (e.g. fixing a bug required more resources to be safe), explain why the regression has occurred in the memorandum of the change request that introduced it.

> 然而，如果性能是在生产系统中使用的一个合理的考虑因素，那么必须进行性能测试，并且应该与回归策略结合使用，旨在防止意外的性能下降。注意，性能回归策略不应阻止回归，而是应该旨在检测它们，直接解决它们，计划在将来解决它们，或者，当不可避免时（例如，修复错误需要更多资源才能安全），在引入它的变更请求备忘录中解释为什么发生了回归。

## Dependencies


Each package should examine the quality levels of their direct runtime dependencies. Packages should not claim a quality level higher than their dependencies, unless it can be reasonably explained why they do not affect the quality of the package in question.

> 每个包应该检查其直接运行时依赖项的质量水平。除非有合理的解释说明这些依赖项不会影响该包的质量，否则包不应声称比其依赖项更高的质量水平。


An example of an exception would be build or \"build tool\" dependencies, which are only used during build time and do not affect the runtime quality of the package. This would not include, however, build dependencies which, for example, contribute only headers to a C++ library or a static library, as the quality of those headers or static library also affect the quality of the runtime product directly. Conversely, this would include something like CMake, which in most ways does not affect the quality of the product.

> 一个例外的例子就是构建或“构建工具”的依赖，它们只在构建时使用，不会影响包的运行时质量。然而，这不包括只提供C++库头文件或静态库的构建依赖，因为这些头文件或静态库的质量也会直接影响运行时产品的质量。相反，这将包括像CMake这样的东西，它在很多方面都不会影响产品的质量。


Dependencies which are other \"ROS\" packages should have these quality standards applied to them and should meet or exceed the quality level claimed by the package in question. Dependencies which are not other \"ROS\" packages should be individually examined for quality. You may either try to apply the requirements for the quality levels described here, or you may wish to simply argue the quality without using these requirements as a ruler. The argument could be text justification, or it could link to other analyses or discussions had by community members rationalizing the choice.

> 依赖于其他“ROS”包的依赖项应该应用这些质量标准，并且应该达到或超过该包所声称的质量水平。不属于其他“ROS”包的依赖项应该单独审查质量。您可以尝试应用此处描述的质量水平的要求，或者您可能希望只是不使用这些要求作为尺子来论证质量。该论据可以是文本论证，也可以链接到社区成员论证选择的其他分析或讨论。


For example, if your package depends on `rclcpp`, and `rclcpp` claims \'Level 1\' quality with the caveat that this requires you use an rmw implementation that also meets the \'Level 1\' quality standard, then your package\'s \"quality declaration\" document should mention this as well. This could be accomplished simply by saying that one of your dependencies, `rclcpp`, has some caveats and then linking to `rclcpp`\'s own \"quality declaration\".

> 例如，如果您的软件包取决于`rclcpp`，而`rclcpp`声称具有“第1级”质量，但有一个前提条件是您必须使用也满足“第1级”质量标准的rmw实现，那么您的软件包的“质量声明”文件也应该提及这一点。这可以通过简单地说您的依赖项之一`rclcpp`有一些注意事项，然后链接到`rclcpp`自己的“质量声明”来实现。


There\'s obviously a lot of ambiguity in this area, as you could argue for or against a variety of dependencies and how they affect the quality of a package. The goal is for the maintainers of a package to \"make the case\" that their dependencies are at least as high quality as the package in question. They should examine each dependency, and document any important caveats or justified exceptions in the package\'s \"quality declaration\" document so peer reviewers and consumers of the package can make their own evaluations.

> 在这个领域显然存在很多歧义，因为你可以为各种依赖关系辩护或反对，以及它们如何影响软件包的质量。目标是让软件包的维护者“说服”他们的依赖关系至少与软件包本身一样高质量。他们应该审查每个依赖关系，并在软件包的“质量声明”文档中记录任何重要的警告或合理的例外，以便同行评审者和软件包的使用者可以做出自己的评估。

## Quality Level 2


These are packages which need to be solidly developed and might be used in production environments, but are not strictly required, or are commonly replaced by custom solutions. This can also include packages which are not yet up to \'Level 1\' but intend to be in the future.

> 这些是需要牢固开发的包，可能会用于生产环境，但不是严格要求的，或者经常被自定义解决方案所取代。这也可以包括尚未达到“Level 1”的包，但未来打算达到。

### Package Requirements

Requirements to be considered a \'Level 2\' package:

1. **Version Policy:**
   i.  The same as \'Level 1\' packages
2. **Change Control Process:**
   i.  Must have all code changes occur through a change request (e.g. pull request, merge request, etc.)
   ii. Must have confirmation of contributor origin (e.g. [DCO](https://developercertificate.org/), CLA, etc.)
   iii. Must have Continuous Integration (CI) policy for all change requests
3. **Documentation:**
   i.  Must have documentation for each \"feature\" (e.g. for `rclcpp`: create a node, publish a message, spin, etc.)
   ii. Must have a declared license or set of licenses
   iii. Must state copyrights within the project and attribute all authors
   iv. Must have a \"quality declaration\" document, which declares the quality level and justifies how the package meets each of the requirements
   a.  *Must have a section in the repository\'s \`\`README\`\` which contains the \"quality declaration\" or links to it*
   b.  *Should register with a centralized list of \'Level 2\' packages, if one exists, to allow for peer review of the claim*
   c.  *Must reference any \'Level 2\' lists the package belongs to, and/or any other peer review processes undergone*
4. **Testing:**
   i.  Must have system tests which cover all items in the \"feature\" documentation
   ii. Code Coverage:
   a.  *Must have code coverage tracking for the package*
   iii. Linters and Static Analysis
   a.  *Must have a code style and enforce it*
   b.  *Must use static analysis tools where applicable*
5. **Dependencies:**
   i.  Must not have direct runtime \"ROS\" dependencies which are not \'Level 2\' dependencies, but\...
   ii. May have optional direct runtime \"ROS\" dependencies which are not \'Level 2\', e.g. tracing or debugging features that can be disabled
   iii. Must have justification for why each direct runtime \"non-ROS\" dependency is equivalent to a \'Level 2\' package in terms of quality
6. **Platform Support:**
   i.  Must support all target platforms for the package\'s ecosystem.
   -   For ROS 2 this means supporting all tier 1 platforms, as defined in [REP-2000](https://www.ros.org/reps/rep-2000.html#support-tiers)
7. **Security**
   i.  Must have a declared Vulnerability Disclosure Policy and adhere to a response schedule for addressing security vulnerabilities


If the above points are satisfied then a package can be considered \'Level 2\'. Refer to the detailed description of the requirements following the Quality Level 1 section above for more information.

> 如果上述要求得到满足，那么可以将包考虑为“第二级”。有关更多信息，请参阅上述质量等级1部分之后的详细要求说明。

## Quality Level 3


These are packages which are useful for development purposes or introspection, but are not recommended for use in embedded products or mission critical scenarios. These packages are more lax on documentation, testing, and scope of public API\'s in order to make development time lower or foster addition of new features.

> 这些包对开发目的或内省有用，但不建议用于嵌入式产品或关键任务场景。 这些包在文档、测试和公共API范围方面更加宽松，以便缩短开发时间或促进新功能的添加。

### Package Requirements

Requirements to be considered a \'Level 3\' package:

1. **Version Policy:**
   i.  The same as \'Level 1\' packages, except:
   a.  *No public API needs to be explicitly declared, though this can make it harder to maintain API and ABI stability*
   b.  *No requirement to keep API/ABI stability within a stable ROS release, but it is still recommended*
2. **Change Control Process:**
   i.  Must have all code changes occur through a change request (e.g. pull request, merge request, etc.)
   ii. Must have Continuous Integration (CI) policy for all change requests
3. **Documentation:**
   i.  Must have a declared license or set of licenses
   ii. Must state copyrights within the project and attribute all authors
   iii. May have a \"quality declaration\" document, which declares the quality level and justifies how the package meets each of the requirements
   a.  *Must have a section in the repository\'s \`\`README\`\` which contains the \"quality declaration\" or links to it*
   b.  *May register with a centralized list of \'Level 3\' packages, if one exists, to allow for peer review of the claim*
   c.  *Must reference any \'Level 3\' lists the package belongs to, and/or any other peer review processes undergone*
4. **Testing:**
   i.  No explicit testing requirements, though covering some if not all of the features with tests is recommended
5. **Dependencies:**

   i.  May have direct runtime \"ROS\" dependencies which are not \'Level 3\' dependencies, but they should still be documented in the quality declaration

> 或许有直接运行时“ROS”依赖，这些依赖不是“第三级”依赖，但它们仍应在质量声明中进行记录。
6. **Platform Support:**
   i.  Must support all target platforms for the package\'s ecosystem.
   -   For ROS 2 this means supporting all tier 1 platforms, as defined in [REP-2000](https://www.ros.org/reps/rep-2000.html#support-tiers)
7. **Security**
   i.  Should have a declared Vulnerability Disclosure Policy and adhere to a response schedule for addressing security vulnerabilities


If the above points are satisfied then a package can be considered \'Level 3\'. Refer to the detailed description of the requirements following the Quality Level 1 section above for more information.

> 如果以上要求都得到满足，那么这个包就可以被认为是'Level 3'。更多信息可参考质量等级1部分以上的详细要求说明。

## Quality Level 4


These are demos, tutorials, or experiments. They don\'t have strict requirements, but are not excluded from having good documentation or tests. For example, this might be a tutorial package which is not intended for reuse but has excellent documentation because it serves primarily as an example to others.

> 这些是演示、教程或实验。它们没有严格的要求，但不排除有良好的文档或测试。例如，这可能是一个教程包，它不是用于重用，但具有出色的文档，因为它主要作为其他人的示例。

### Package Requirements

Requirements to be considered a \'Level 4\' package:

1. **Version Policy:**

   i.  No requirements, but having a policy is still recommended (e.g. `semver`), even if the version is not yet stable (e.g. \>= 1.0.0 for `semver`)

> 没有要求，但仍然建议有一个政策（例如`semver`），即使版本尚未稳定（例如`semver`的`> = 1.0.0`）
2. **Change Control Process:**
   i.  No explicit change control process required, but still recommended
3. **Documentation:**
   i.  Must have a declared license or set of licenses
   ii. Must state copyrights within the project and attribute all authors
4. **Testing:**
   i.  No explicit testing requirements, though covering some if not all of the features with tests is recommended
5. **Dependencies:**
   i.  No restrictions
6. **Platform Support:**
   i.  Must support all target platforms for the package\'s ecosystem.
   -   For ROS 2 this means supporting all tier 1 platforms, as defined in [REP-2000](https://www.ros.org/reps/rep-2000.html#support-tiers)
7. **Security**
   i.  No restrictions


Any package that does not claim to be \'Level 3\' or higher quality is automatically \'Level 4\'. Refer to the detailed description of the requirements following the Quality Level 1 section above for more information.

> 任何未声明为“3级”或更高级别质量的包都被自动认定为“4级”。有关更多信息，请参阅上述质量等级1部分后面的详细要求说明。

## Quality Level 5


Packages in this category cannot even meet the simple \'Level 4\' requirements, and for that reason should not be used. \'Level 5\' has no requirements, but we still strongly recommend all packages have a license and copyright statement, ideally in each file.

> 在这个类别中的包甚至无法满足简单的“Level 4”要求，因此不应使用。“Level 5”没有要求，但我们仍然强烈建议所有包都具有许可证和版权声明，最好是在每个文件中。

## Repository Organization


Since these categories are applied on a per package basis, and since there may be more than one package per source repository, it\'s recommended that the strictest set of policies apply to the whole repository. This is recommended rather than trying to mix processes depending on which packages are changed in a given change request (pull request or merge request, etc.). If this is too onerous, then it\'s recommended to split lower quality packages out into a separate repository.

> 由于这些类别是按照每个包的基础应用的，并且可能有多个包每个源存储库，建议最严格的一套政策适用于整个存储库。这比尝试根据给定变更请求（拉取请求或合并请求等）中更改的包来混合进程更受推荐。如果这太过繁琐，那么建议将较低质量的包拆分到单独的存储库中。

# Reference Implementation


The [ROS 2 Developer Guide](https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/Contributing/Developer-Guide/) describes the policies we implement to achieve Quality Level 1 for ROS Core packages.

> 《ROS 2开发者指南》（https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/Contributing/Developer-Guide/）描述了我们实施的政策，以实现ROS核心软件包的质量等级1。


The [rcutils package\'s quality declaration](https://github.com/ros2/rcutils/blob/4157542d6320091cef715115d587625fd926500b/QUALITY_DECLARATION.md) is one example of the conditions of this REP in practice on a non-trivial package.

> rcutils 包的质量声明（https://github.com/ros2/rcutils/blob/4157542d6320091cef715115d587625fd926500b/QUALITY_DECLARATION.md）是这个REP在一个非平凡包上实践条件的一个例子。


The following template is a suggestion; packages can choose to combine sub-items into one heading if applicable (e.g. \[3.i\]-\[3.iv\] combined into \[3\]).

> 以下模板是一个建议；如果可行，包可以选择将子项合并到一个标题中（例如\[3.i\] - \[3.iv\]合并为\[3\]）。

## Quality Declaration Template

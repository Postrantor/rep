> REP：125 标题：rosdep 2 作者：Ken Conley 状态：最终 类型：标准跟踪 内容类型：文本/X-RST 创建日期：2012年2月10日 ROS版本：Fuerte 后史：2012年2月10日

# Abstract


This REP describes a \"rosdep 2\" tool that is significantly different from its predecessor[^1]. This new version uses a \"sources list\", similar in semantics to the `apt` tool[^2]. It is also a standalone tool that can be separately installed and used with or without a ROS package system.

> 这个REP描述了一个与其前身有很大不同的“rosdep 2”工具[^1]。这个新版本使用类似于“apt”工具[^2]的语义的“源列表”。它也是一个独立的工具，可以单独安装并在没有ROS软件包系统的情况下使用。

This specification is meant to be minimal. See \"Future Improvements\" for possible extensions.

# Example workflow

The example workflows below provide a high-level sketch of how rosdep 2 is used. The main differences are:

> 1. Standalone installation.
> 2. Installation requires an `init` and `update` step to create the local database.
> 3. More querying APIs.

Installation:

```
sudo pip install -U rosdep
sudo rosdep init
rosdep update
```

Common installation workflow:

```
$ rosdep check ros_comm
All system dependencies have been satisified
$ rosdep install geometry
```

Querying:

```
$ rosdep keys roscpp
pkg-config

$ rosdep resolve pkg-config
pkg-config

$ rosdep keys geometry
eigen
apr
glut
python-sip
python-numpy
graphviz
paramiko
cppunit
libxext
log4cxx
pkg-config

$ rosdep resolve eigen
libeigen3-dev
```

# Resolution specification


rosdep 2 loads *valid data sources* specified in the sources list in order. This follows the behavior of apt, which designates the \"most preferred source listed first.\"

> rosdep 2 加载源列表中指定的*有效数据源*，按顺序加载。这遵循apt的行为，其中将“最优先列出的源”指定为第一项。


Each rosdep entry from the data sources is combined into a single rosdep database. Entries from data sources listed higher in the sources have higher precedence.

> 每个来自数据源的rosdep条目都被组合到一个rosdep数据库中。源中列出的条目优先级越高。

A data source is considered *valid* if all of its tags match the local tags. A data source with no tags is always loaded.

## Tags

The following tags are set for the local rosdep instance:

- `ROS-DISTRO-CODENAME`, e.g. `fuerte`
- `OS-NAME`, e.g. `ubuntu`
- `OS-VERSION-CODENAME`, e.g. `lucid`

For example, on Ubuntu Lucid 10.04, with the ROS Fuerte distribution, the tags for the local rosdep instance would be: `fuerte, ubuntu, lucid`.


`OS-NAME` and `OS-VERSION-CODENAME` are the same values that the `rosdep.yaml` file format uses[^3]. NOTE: REP 111 refers to `OS-VERSION-CODENAME` as `OS_VERSION`. Here we attach `CODENAME` to explicitly refer to the codename, not the numerical version marker.

> `OS-NAME`和`OS-VERSION-CODENAME`是`rosdep.yaml`文件格式使用的相同值。注意：REP 111将`OS-VERSION-CODENAME`称为`OS_VERSION`。在这里，我们附上`CODENAME`以明确指代代号，而不是数字版本标记。

## Conflict resolution


There are no longer conflicts in rosdep 2. `rosdep.yaml` files are processed in order of precedence, with the first entry for a rosdep key \"winning\". Subsequent entries for the same key, even if they are non-conflicting, are not merged.

> 没有rosdep 2中的冲突了。 `rosdep.yaml` 文件按优先级顺序处理，第一个rosdep键的条目“获胜”。 后续对相同键的条目，即使它们不冲突，也不会合并。

## Caching

rosdep 2 always loads its database from a local cache. The user must explicitly update this local cache to get new resolution rules.

# File format specification

This specification uses the same `rosdep.yaml` file format as defined in REP 111[^4] and also described more concisely in[^5].

## Data sources .list format

A `.list` file lists *data sources*, with the most preferred data source first. The general format is:

```
source-type uri [tags...]
```

Where `source-type` can be:

> `yaml`
>
>> `rosdep.yaml` file
>>
>
> `gbpdistro`
>
>> `gbpdistro` file.
>>

Lines that start with a `#` are considered to be comments.

Example file:

```
yaml https://github.com/ros/rosdistro/raw/master/rosdep/base.yaml
yaml https://github.com/ros/rosdistro/raw/master/rosdep/python.yaml
gbpdistro https://github.com/ros/rosdistro/raw/master/releases/fuerte.yaml fuerte
```

## gbpdistro files


`gbpdistro` refers to a `git-buildpackage`-based toolchain currently in use for building REP 122-compliant stacks. This toolchain is still in a prototype phase; thus, this `gbpdistro` specification is unstable.

> `gbpdistro`指的是一种基于git-buildpackage的工具链，目前用于构建符合REP 122规范的堆栈。该工具链仍处于原型阶段，因此此`gbpdistro`规范不稳定。

This REP does not define the `gbpdistro` format, but it is assumed to be a YAML file with that conforms to:

```
gbp-repos:
- name: NAME1
  target: all
  url: git://github.com/PROJECT1/REPO1.git
- name: NAME2
  target: [lucid, oneiric]
  url: git://github.com/PROJECT2/REPO2.git
release-name: RELEASE-NAME
```


rosdep 2 can create a data source based on a `gbpdistro` file. For each entry in the `gbp-repos` key, rosdep 2 produces a rosdep key for `NAME` that maps to the Ubuntu package name `ros-<RELEASE-NAME>-<NAME>`. In the future, this mechanism could also be used to produce rosdep key mappings for other platforms, like OS X Homebrew.

> rosdep 2可以基于`gbpdistro`文件创建数据源。对于`gbp-repos`键中的每个条目，rosdep 2为`NAME`生成一个rosdep键，将其映射到Ubuntu软件包名称`ros-<RELEASE-NAME>-<NAME>`。将来，这种机制也可以用于为其他平台（如OS X Homebrew）生成rosdep键映射。


rosdep 2 uses a \"targets\" file that provides a lookup table for resolving `all` targets based on `RELEASE-NAME`. The targets files is a machine-readable representation of REP 3[^6].

> rosdep 2使用一个"targets"文件，该文件提供一个查找表，用于基于RELEASE-NAME解析所有目标。该targets文件是REP 3的机器可读表示[^6]。

## /etc/ros/rosdep/sources.list.d

rosdep 2 uses a similar definition as apt `sources.list.d`[^7]:

> The `/etc/ros/rosdep/sources.list.d` directory provides a way to add entries in separate files. File names need to end with .list and may only contain letters (a-z and A-Z), digits (0-9), underscore (\_), hyphen (-) and period (.) characters. Otherwise they will be silently ignored.


For simplicity, we don\'t implement an `/etc/ros/rosdep/sources.list` and instead soley use the `/etc/ros/rosdep/sources.list.d/` implementation, which is much easier for idempotent configuration by scripts.

> 为了简化，我们不实现`/etc/ros/rosdep/sources.list`，而是仅使用`/etc/ros/rosdep/sources.list.d/`实现，这样可以更容易地用脚本进行幂等配置。

# Command-line specification

## Updated rosdep commands

`db`

> No longer takes in any arguments and uses the easier to type `db` instead of `depdb`. The database that is used to resolve rosdep keys is determined by the sources list, and thus is not dependent on a particular resource (e.g. ROS package or stack). The previous `depdb` command is still processed but not promoted.

`what-needs <rosdeps>`

`where-defined <rosdeps>`

> Both commands are the same as their predecessors, but use a more consistent dash separator. The previous versions are supported but not promoted.

## New rosdep commands

`init`

> Initializes a default `/etc/ros/rosdep/sources.list.d` directory for the user. This is a bootstrapping command that only needs to be run once, most likely as:
>
> ```
> sudo rosdep init
> ```

`keys <stacks-and-packages>`

> List the rosdep keys that the ROS stacks and packages depend on. This command only works with a `ROS_PACKAGE_PATH` set.

`resolve <rosdeps>`

> Prints the resolution of the listed rosdeps to the console. This enables users to easily query rosdep and verify its behavior. It is meant to be used together with the `keys` command.

`update`

> Processes `/etc/ros/rosdep/sources.list.d` and downloads new datafiles for the local database. This is the only command that examines remote sources. All other commands are processed against local data.

# Motivation


The original rosdep gave preference to the developer of a ROS stack. It enabled that developer to declare dependency rules and distribute them with the stack. As a corollary, it strongly favored reproducibility and correctness: old source trees could be checked out and be built the same way. As a result of these goals, rosdep rules were stored with code. Also, aggregation of rules in lower-level stacks was frowned upon, as it would restrict downstream developers

> 原始的rosdep给ROS堆栈的开发者做出了偏好。它使得那个开发者能够声明依赖规则，并且随堆栈一起分发。作为其结果，它强烈支持可复现性和正确性：旧的源树可以被检出并且以同样的方式构建。由于这些目标，rosdep规则被存储在代码中。此外，在较低级别的堆栈中的规则聚合被反对，因为它会限制下游开发者。

This design has not scaled very well. There are several issues, in particular, that have strongly motivated a redesign:


- Updates the the rosdep rules for new platforms requires re-releasing code, even though the code is unchanged. This creates significant delays porting ROS to new platforms.

> 更新rosdep规则以适配新平台需要重新发布代码，即使代码没有改变。这导致将ROS移植到新平台的过程变得非常缓慢。
- Conflicts require re-releasing code to resolve.
- Different stacks see different resolution databases, which creates confusion.
- Rosdep aggregator stacks, like `common_rosdeps` become inevitable to avoid conflicting and duplicating rules.

The rosdep 2 design favors the end-user as well as maintainers of software distributions. The main goals of rosdep 2 are:

> 1. Clarity of resolution.
> 2. Easily end-user control over rosdep resolution.

The semantics of Ubuntu\'s `apt` tool are followed as much as possible to provide familiarity.

# Backwards compatibility

## stack/rosdep.yaml

The main incompatibility is rosdep 2 does not read `rosdep.yaml` files from ROS stacks. It only loads from data sources in the sources list.

## Command-line API


There are minor incompatibilities in the command-line API. The main installation commands are also the same, so many scripts based on rosdep are likely to continue to work. However, the new rosdep command requires an initialization/update step to create the rosdep database, which may cause some initial incompatibilities. Scripts that use rosdep and run on freshly installed machines, such as chroots, will be especially effected.

> 有一些命令行API的輕微不相容性。主要的安裝命令也是相同的，因此基於rosdep的許多腳本可能仍然會繼續工作。但是，新的rosdep命令需要初始化/更新步驟來創建rosdep數據庫，這可能會導致一些初步的不相容性。在新安裝的機器上使用rosdep並運行的腳本，如chroots，將特別受到影響。


The output format of some commands, like `db` and `where-defined` have been changed for clarity and easier processing. As far as the author knows, no scripts depend on the output format of these commands.

> 一些命令，比如`db`和`where-defined`的输出格式已经改变，以提高清晰度和更容易处理。据作者所知，没有脚本依赖这些命令的输出格式。

For example, rosdep 1:

```
$ rosdep where_defined eigen
eigen defined in set(['/opt/ros/electric/stacks/common_rosdeps/rosdep.yaml', ">>/opt/ros/electric/stacks/common_rosdeps/rosdep.yaml<<Unused due to package 'common_rosdeps' being in a stack.]]"])
```

rosdep 2:

```
$ rosdep where-defined eigen
https://github.com/ros/rosdistro/raw/master/rosdep/base.yaml
```

## rosmake

rosmake no longer has options for invoking rosdep internally as rosdep is now an external tool.

# Rationale

## New querying APIs


Although the querying APIs go beyond the minimal specification necessary for rosdep 2, they were useful in its development as they provide command-line verification of the resolution behavior. For the same reasons, the new querying APIs make rosdep\'s behavior more clear to the end user. Users can see the rosdep keys that are tied to a particular ROS package. The user can also see how those keys relate to system dependencies prior to performing installation.

> 尽管查询API超出了rosdep 2所必需的最低规范，但它们在开发中非常有用，因为它们提供了命令行验证解析行为。出于同样的原因，新的查询API使rosdep的行为对最终用户更加清晰。用户可以看到与特定ROS包相关的rosdep键。用户还可以在执行安装之前看到这些键如何与系统依赖项相关联。

## New conflict rules


The new rosdep eschews conflict in favor of clarity. A particular rosdep entry always comes from a single source, and the source that is chosen is the one that is ranked highest. An alternative would have been to merge compatible rules for a rosdep key, such as rules that have non-intersecting OSes. This would mean that entries could come from multiple sources, which is less clear.

> 新的rosdep放弃冲突，追求清晰。某个rosdep条目总是来自单一来源，选择的来源是排名最高的。另一种选择是合并适用于rosdep键的兼容规则，例如具有非交叉操作系统的规则。这意味着条目可以来自多个来源，这不太清楚。

## Lack of backwards compatibility


The initial reference implementation loaded `rosdep.yaml` files from stacks as well, but it increased confusion. Based on the specific implementation:

> 最初的参考实现也从堆栈中加载了`rosdep.yaml`文件，但这增加了混乱。根据特定的实现：

- rosdep entries from the sources list were shadowed by stack-based `rosdep.yaml` files.
- or, stack-based `rosdep.yaml` files were shadowed by rosdep entries loaded from the sources list.


Either of these conflicts with the goal of providing clear resolution to the user. Furthermore, it requires maintaining dual sets of `rosdep.yaml` files.

> 这两者都与为用户提供清晰的解决方案的目标相冲突。此外，它还需要维护双套`rosdep.yaml`文件。

## No support for ROS_ETC_DIR

rosdep 2 does not obey the `ROS_ETC_DIR` environment variable defined in REP 124[^8]. This decision was made for four reasons:

> 1. Confusing behavior with `rosdep init`, which is run under `sudo` and thus would require an extra command-line arguments to preserve environment variables.
> 2. Conflicts with goal of clarity. rosdep always uses the same local database.
> 3. \"tags\" in the `.list` file format implicitly support multiple distributions.
> 4. rosdep 2 is a standalone tool not included with any ROS distribution.

# Future improvements

## rosdep keys as arguments to package-based commands

The following rosdep command take in `<stacks-and-packages>` as arguments:

- check
- install
- keys
- resolve

In order to support `rosdep` as its own standalone tool, it is easy to imagine extending each of those commands to take rosdep keys as well.


This improvement has strong synergy with ROS Fuerte, which transitions lower-level stacks to be rosdep keys. For example, `ros_comm` is both a stack name and a rosdep key.

> 这种改进与ROS Fuerte有很强的协同作用，它将较低层次的堆栈转换为rosdep键。例如，`ros_comm`既是一个堆栈名称，也是一个rosdep键。

## More configurability


The `rosdep init` and `rosdep update` commands will likely need more configurability than their current bare specification provide. For example, it will be desirable to configure them to use a different sources list than `/etc/ros/rosdep/sources.list.d`.

> `rosdep init`和`rosdep update`命令可能需要比当前简单规范提供更多的可配置性。例如，有必要配置它们使用不同于`/etc/ros/rosdep/sources.list.d`的源列表。

# Reference implementation

The `rosdep2` package provides a reference implementation of this specification. It can be installed via `pip`:

```
sudo pip install -U rosdep
```

A Git repository is available at `https://github.com/ros-infrastructure/rosdep`.

The reference implementation is not yet fully compatible with this specification.
